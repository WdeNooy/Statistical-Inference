# Notes

# PDF output:
#* Embedded shiny apps: Lots of whitespace within the screenshot. Helps to define out.height in chunk - no. cliprect = 'viewport' does not work. selector = "#sampling-distribution-summary1" does not work. vwidth=420, vheight=620 does not work. Setting dev="png" works even though some whitespace remains under the app. Specify out.width (to get a caption) but don't specify out.height (increases the app size).
#* Interactive network visualizations (flow chart in 4.2 Formulating Statistical Hypotheses, mediation models in 9.6 Path Model with Regression Analysis) badly captured (due to fig.asp="50%"?) with lots of whitespace (and of course no link to interactive version). Adding out.width and/or out.height seems to create new problems (mean-centering of consecutive text, caption rendered as LaTex...). Manual screenshots shown with screenshot.alt = "".
#* No screen shots for videos embedded with iframe (4.2.9 Comparing Means in SPSS). Also, a separate figure caption is not numbered. Solved by embedding them with knitr::include_url and dev = "png" but this puts videos in a floating context, so they are no longer in the Instructions section in the PDF. 
#* Manually adjust .tex file: replace \begin{figure} by \begin{figure}[H]. Also apply to tables to stop them from floating. Manual screenshots of videos (with correct file names) in figures\videoshots. Copy all to _book\GentleIntro_files\figure-latex and recompile .tex file. Note: Also copy all files in figure-latex directory from _bookdown_files\GentleIntro_files  to the _book\GentleIntro_files.
#* Including a manual screen shot with screenshot.alt = "" solves the white-space problem but it does not add a link to the interactive content (shiny app). Only applicable to dynamic networks that have no link anyhow.

#* Only caption to figure if out.width is set.
#* kable tables are not adjusted to the page margins (see 2.5.2 Conditions for the use of theoretical probability distributions, 9.6.3 Partial and full mediation). out.width="100%" does not help.

#* Equations: use aligned instead of align. But aligned does not work in HTML - need different package to render equations in HTML? 
#* Equations are numbered with the section number. The number is not displayed with the equation itself.

#* HTML table to arrange text and pictures does not work: 2.1 (baron), 3.5.1 (Neyman), 5.2 (metal detector), 5.3.1 (Pearson), 6.3.2 (Gauss, LaPlace). Size of picture must be made explicit. Embed with knitr::include_graphics and set output.width? Note that include_graphics makes the picture float, which is not what I want with portraits. Also, the dpi seems to matter to eventual out.width of r chunck with include_graphics.

# Links to external resources such as (SPSS) data must be absolute. They cannot be stored in the R Markdown doc root directory, so I store them in a data subdirectory of the shiny server http://82.196.4.233:3838/data. Embed links as HTML with target="_blank" to open the resource in a new window otherwise the Shiny server displays the R Markdown document in grey (must be reloaded).

# Include SPSS tabular output:
#- Right-click table, select Style Output, Select as Group (Continue), Table Look, Compact.
#- Select tales to be exported. Don't select separate analysis titles, they are badly formatted.
#- Right-click selected table and export as HTML, Change Options: Export visible layer only, Export without styling, Include footnotes and captions, Export visible view only.
#- Export HTML file to R project directory.
#- Include HTML file in R Markdown within <iframe>. Set width="100%" and experiment to find the right height.
# Note that html content embedded in this way yields problems with webshot capturing if the document is knitted into PDF.

# Introduction and Reader's Guide {-}

In the years that I have been teaching inferential statistics to bachelor students in Communication Science, I have learned two things. First, it is paramount that students thoroughly understand the principles of statistical inference before they can apply statistical inference correctly themselves. Second, formal notation, manual calculation, and estimation details distract rather than help students understand what they are doing. This book offers a non-technical but thorough introduction to statistical inference. It discusses a minimal set of concepts needed to understand both the possibilities and pitfalls of estimation, null hypothesis testing, moderation, and mediation analysis. It uses a minimum of formal notation.

### Intended Audience and Setting {-}

This book is written as reading material for a follow-up course in statistics, in the bachelor of Communication Science at the University of Amsterdam. Students enrolled in this course have passe an introductory course in statistics that explained how to change research questions into variables and associations between variables, how to select and execute the correct analysis or test (in SPSS) to answer their research question, and how to interpret the results in a language that is both comprehensible for the average reader and complying with professional standards (APA standard for reporting test results). In addition, they have learned the very basics of inferential statistics: How to decide which null hypothesis to reject based on reported _p_ values, and how to interpret confidence intervals.  

This book is meant for use in a flipped-classroom setting. Students should read the text, watch embedded videos, and play with the interactive content before they meet in class. Class meetings are used to answer questions raised by the students, do group work to exercise with the concepts and techniques presented in the text, and do short tests to check understanding.  

### Interactive Content {-}

The interactive content in this book replaces simulations that used to be demonstrated during lectures. I expect that doing simulations yourself rather than watching them being done by someone else enhances understanding. I have tried to break down the simulations into smaller steps, confronting the student several times with essentially the same simulation, but with added complexity. I hope that this approach enhances understanding and remembrance and, at the same time, avoids frustration caused by complex dashboards offering all options at once. 

Most interactive content starts with a question regarding the student's expectations of what is going to happen in the simulation. I strongly recommend that students state their expectations before they start the simulations to see where their intuitions are right and where they are wrong.

Adam Sasiadek developed the more complicated Shiny apps in this book. The College of Communication at the University of Amsterdam generously supported the creation of the apps whereas this university's Grassroots Project for ICT in education refused to support it. Renske van Bronswijk corrected my English. Any remaining errors result from changes and additions that I applied afterwards. My colleague Peter Neijens commented on a draft of this text. Among the first tutors using this book, Chei Billedo, Marcel van Egmond, Matthijs Elenbaas, Andreas Goldberg, Bregje van Groningen, Luzia Helfer, Rhianne Hoek, Laura Jacobs, Jeroen Jonkman, Fam te Poel, Sanne Schinkel, Christin Scholz,Ragnheiður Torfadóttir, and she whose name I am not allowed to mention offered many suggestions that improved the text substantially. Among the students who helped to improve the book, Alissa Hilbertz stands out for her careful language corrections and suggestions.
