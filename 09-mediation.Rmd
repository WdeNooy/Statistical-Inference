### Summary {-}

```{block2, type='rmdimportant'}
What happens if I use more than one predictor in a regression model? Can I add a causal order to the predictors?
```

If we analyze the effects of two or more predictors on a dependent variable in a regression model, the effect of a predictor is adjusted for the effects of other predictors. Each predictor only predicts the part of the scores on the dependent variable that cannot be predicted by the other predictors. If we predict newspaper reading time, for example, from age and interest in politics, age predicts the part of newspaper reading time that interest in politics cannot predict.

Because the effects of predictors are adjusted for the effects of other predictors, the effects of all predictors may change if a new predictor is added to a regression model. The effects can become stronger (the new variable was a suppressor) or weaker and even change direction (the new variable was a reinforcer). For example, adding respondents' news site use to the regression model predicting newspaper reading time from age may change the effect of age on newspaper reading time.

Indirect correlations play a central role here: The correlation of a predictor (age) with the dependent variable (newspaper reading time) due to the fact that the predictor (age) is correlated with another predictor (news site use) that is also correlated with the dependent variable (newspaper reading time). The size of the indirect correlation is simply the product of the correlation between the two predictors (age and news site use) and the standardized regression effect of the other predictor (news site use) on the dependent variable (newspaper reading time).

If we add a causal order among the predictors of our regression model, we obtain a causal model or path model. The causal model includes an indirect effect: The first predictor affects the scores on the second predictor, which affects the scores on the dependent variable that we usually call the outcome variable. For example, age affects news site use, which affects newspaper reading time. In this path model, the second predictor (news site use) mediates the effect of the first predictor on the outcome variable. The second predictor is called a mediator.

We can estimate a path model as a series of regression models. With additional software, we can also estimate the confidence interval of an indirect effect. The causal order underlying the path model, however, is an assumption that we make. A regression model shows the predictive effects, which need not be causal. We cannot prove that the predictive effects are causal. We can only think of arguments that make a causal effect plausible.

## Controlling for Effects of Other Predictors {#controlling}

In a regression model, we use the variation in scores on independent variables to predict the variation of scores on the dependent variable: Does a person with a higher score on an independent variable also have a higher score or, on the contrary, a lower score on the dependent variable? A simple regression model contains only one independent variable but a multiple regression model includes more than one.

For example, European citizens who are older spend more time on reading newspapers and so do citizens who are more interested in politics. We have two independent variables (age and interest in politics) to predict the dependent variable (newspaper reading time). The two independent variables can be correlated: Older citizens tend to be more interested in politics. How does the regression model decide which independent variable is responsible for which part of the variation on the dependent variable?

### Partial effect  

How does a multiple regression model control the effect of an independent variable for the effects of all other independent variables? Conceptually, the regression model first removes the variation in the dependent variable that is predicted by all other independent variables. Then it determines how well the remaining independent variable predicts the variation that is left (residual variation). This is the variation in outcome scores that can be predicted by this particular independent variable but not by any of the other independent variables in the model.

In this sense, a regression coefficient in a multiple regression model expresses the unique contribution of a variable to the prediction of the dependent variable. It is the contribution to the prediction of the dependent variable over and above the predictions that we can make with all other independent variables in the model. This is called a _partial effect_. This is what we mean if we say that we are _controlling for all other independent variables_ in our interpretation of a regression model. 

### Confounding variables

It is important to note that the effect is only unique in comparison to the other independent variables that are included in the model. It may well be that we did not include variables in the model that are actually responsible for part of the effects that are attributed to the independent variables in the model. Such left-out variables are called _confounding variables_ or, for short, _confounders_.

If we include a confounder as a new independent variable in the model, the partial effects of other independent variables in the model change. In Figure \@ref(fig:mediation-multipleregression), for instance, this happens if you add news site use to a model containing age as a predictor for newspaper reading time. The effects of other independent variables are adjusted to a new situation, namely a situation with news site use as a new independent variable. News site use helps to predict variation in the dependent variable, so the variation left to be explained by age changes. In Section \@ref(confounders), we will learn that regression coefficients can increase and decrease if confounders are included in the model.

With non-experimental data, for example data on newspaper reading habits gathered in a survey, we must include all confounders to ensure that the estimated regression coefficients represent the effects of the independent variables and not effects of confounders. In practical applications, we can only include a limited number of variables in our research and we do not always know what the confounders are. We should strive to include the most important confounders in our research project but we should always keep in mind that the predictive effects that we find may be due to variables not included in our regression model. If there are confounders, our model suffers from _omitted variable bias_.

Answer to Question 1. 

* The effect of age remains more or less the same, around 0.9, if we control
for education.
* The negative effect of education if we do not control for age (gray),
disappears if we control for age (blue). The blue dot for education is near
zero (and positive rather than negative) and the confidence interval includes
zero. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.1.1)

```{block2, type='rmdanswer'}
Answer to Question 2. 

* The regression coefficient of age changes most when we add news site use as
an independent variable to the model. The effect of age becomes weaker (around
0.7).
* Using internet as news source probably reduces newspaper reading time because
news can be retrieved from the internet. Older people are less likely to use
the internet as news source, so part of the positive effect of age on newspaper
reading time is actually due to the fact that older people use news sites less
because of their age. That part of the age effect disappears if we add news
site use as an independent variable to the model. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.1.2)
```
  
<A name="answer9.1.3"></A>
```{block2, type='rmdanswer'}
Answer to Question 3. 

* A simple regression model contains only one independent variable. The
regression coefficient represents the effect of this independent variable
without controlling for the effects of other independent variable.
* These effects are positive for age and political interest in the example:
Older people and people who are more interested in politics are predicted to
spend more time on reading newspapers. The effects are negative for education
and news site use: People with more (years of) education or more frequently
using news sites are predicted to spend less time on reading newspapers.
* If we select only one independent variable, we have a simple regression
model, so the independent variable's blue effect must be equal to its gray
effect. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.1.3)

1. Which variable confounds the effect of political interest on newspaper reading time most? And why is that so? Add confounders to the model in Figure \@ref(fig:mediation-indirectcorrelation) and try to explain why the change is small or large. [<img src="icons/2answer.png" width=115px align="right">](#answer9.2.1)
```

When is a variable a confounder and when is it a stronger confounder, changing the effect of another predictor a lot? The answer to the first part of this question is easy: A _confounder_ is a variable that is correlated with both the predictor and dependent variable but is not (yet) included itself in the regression model. Because of the correlations, a confounder establishes an _indirect correlation_ between the predictor and dependent variable.

The size of the indirect correlation is equal to the product of the correlation between confounder and predictor and the correlation between confounder and dependent variable. In Figure \@ref(fig:mediation-indirectcorrelation), the correlation between age and interest in politics is .12 and the correlation between age and newspaper reading time is .88, the indirect correlation between interest in politics and reading time established by age is .12 * .88 = .11.

### Indirect correlation and size of confounding

In Figure \@ref(fig:mediation-indirectcorrelation), we start with a simple regression model with political interest as the only predictor of newspaper reading time. Respondent's age, however, is correlated both with political interest ($r = 0.12$) and with newspaper reading time ($r = 0.88$). Age creates a positive indirect correlation between political interest and reading time. 

As long as age is not included in the regression model, the model believes that the indirect correlation due to age is part of the effect of political interest. It assigns the indirect correlation due to age erroneously to the partial effect of political interest, that is, to the regression coefficient of political interest. In this  situation, the regression coefficient for political interest expresses both the effect of political interest itself and the effect of age (the confounder).

Once we add age as a new predictor to the regression model, the indirect correlation due to age is removed from the effect of political interest. The effect of age on newspaper reading time is now correctly assigned to age. As a result, the value of the regression coefficient for political interest changes if we add age as a new predictor.

The size of the change usually is closely related to the size of the indirect correlation, so the larger the indirect correlation, the more the regression coefficient of political interest changes if age (the former confounder) is included as a new predictor. This answers the second part of the question with which we started Section \@ref(indirectcorrelation): When is a variable a stronger confounder?

If you love the details: The size of the change is not exactly the same as the size of the indirect correlation. It is equal to the correlation between the confounder (age) and the predictor (political interest) times the partial effect (standardized regression coefficient) of the confounder (age) on the dependent variable (newspaper reading time) that controls for the effect of the predictor (political interest). 

### Confounders are not included in the regression model

Finally, it is important to remember that a confounder, such as age in the present example, is a variable that is __not included in our regression model__. As long as it is not included, the indirect correlation between predictor (political interest) and outcome (newspaper reading time) due to the confounder (age) is not controlled for when the effect of the predictor is estimated. The estimated effect is not correct, it is confounded (confused) with the effect of the confounder.

Once the confounder (age) is added to the regression model, however, the estimated effects are controlling for the variable formerly known as a confounder. The effects no longer partly represent the effect of the former confounder. In other words, they are no longer confounded by the effect of that variable. The former confounding variable now is a predictor or, if we are not interested in its effects, a _covariate_ or _control variable_ in the regression model.

```{block2, type='rmdanswer'}
Answer to Question 1. 

* Age is the strongest confounder in this example. If we add age as a
predictor to the model, the partial effect of political interest on reading
time is 0.04. The (simple) effect of this predictor is 0.14 if we do not
control for age, so the effect difference is 0.10.
* The difference between the simple and partial effect of political interest
on reading time is smaller for news site use and education.
* Because age is most strongly related to both political interest and reading
time, it affects the effect of political interest on reading time most
strongly. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.2.1)

In the preceding section, we learned that a partial effect expressed by a regression coefficient may change if a new predictor is added to the regression model. The partial effect of a predictor changes if the added variable is a confounder: It is correlated both with the predictor and dependent variable. In other words, there is an indirect correlation between the predictor and dependent variable due to the confounding variable.

The partial effect of a predictor can become stronger, weaker, or even change direction if we add a confounder to the regression model. The current section describes the two types of confounders that are responsible for these changes: suppressors and reinforcers.

### Suppression {#suppression}

A predictor's effect becomes stronger if we include a confounding variable that is responsible for an indirect correlation that points in the opposite direction of the effect of the predictor in the model without the confounder. Here, the indirect correlation contradicts the effect of the predictor and as a result, the effect of the predictor is underestimated (suppressed) if the confounder is not included in the model. The confounder is a _suppressor variable_. If we add it to the model, it no longer suppresses the effect of the predictor, so this effect becomes stronger.

There are two situations in which an indirect correlation can have the opposite sign of the effect of a predictor:

1. The indirect correlation is negative but the effect of the predictor is positive.

2. The indirect correlation is positive but the effect of the predictor is negative.

Let us start with the first situation and discuss the second situation later on in this section.

Let us assume that political interest has a positive effect on reading newspapers. People who are more interested in politics tend to spend more time on reading newspapers than people who are less interested in politics. The use of news sites confounds this effect if it is correlated with both political interest and newspaper reading time. What happens if people interested in politics use news sites more often (positive correlation) but using news sites decreases newspaper reading time (negative correlation)?

In this situation, the indirect correlation between political interest and newspaper reading time due to news site use is negative: Positive times negative yields a negative. The indirect correlation tells us that people interested in politics use news sites more frequently and for that reason read newspapers less often. The indirect correlation clearly contradicts the regression effect of political interest on newspaper reading time, which is positive: People who are more interested in politics spend more time on reading newspapers.

If news site use is not included in the regression model, the standardized regression effect of political interest more or less adds the indirect correlation to the effect of political interest. Adding a negative amount (indirect correlation), however, is equal to subtracting this amount from the standardized regression coefficient. The positive effect of political interest on reading time is underestimated. In this example, the effect of political interest is _suppressed_ (_masked_) by the confounder news site use. News site use is a _suppressor variable_. 

If we include this suppressor variable (news site use) in our regression model, we eliminate its suppression of the effect of political interest on newspaper reading time. The negative effect of news site use on reading time is captured by the regression coefficient for the new news site use predictor. The effect of political interest on newspaper reading time is now controlled for the effect of news site use; it no longer includes the indirect correlation due to news site use. In this example, the effect of political interest on newspaper reading time becomes more strongly positive.

```{r suppression2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Interest in politics as a confounder of the effect of news site use on newspaper reading time.", fig.asp=0.3}
library(ggplot2)
# Create coordinates for the variable names.
variables <- data.frame(x = c(0.3, 0.38, 0.5, 0.62, 0.7, 0.5), 
                        y = c(.1, .2, .3, .2, .1, .1),
                        label = c("News Site Use", "+", "Pol.Interest", "+", "Reading Time", "-"))
ggplot(variables, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = variables$x[1], y = variables$y[1], xend = variables$x[5] - 0.06, yend = variables$y[1]), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.04, "npc"), type = "closed")) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = variables$x[1], y = variables$y[1], xend = variables$x[3] - 0.04, yend = variables$y[3]), size = 2, colour = "grey") + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = variables$x[3] + 0.04, y = variables$y[3], xend = variables$x[5], yend = variables$y[5]), size = 2, colour = "grey") + 
  geom_label(aes(label=label)) + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0.2, 0.8), ylim = c(0, 0.4)) +
  theme_void()
# Cleanup.
rm(variables)
```

Now, let us have a look at the situation in which the indirect correlation is positive but the regression effect of the predictor is negative. Just reverse the example and make news site use the predictor and political interest the confounder. The regression effect of news site use on newspaper reading time is negative if people tend to use news sites instead of newspapers as sources of information. The indirect correlation due to political interest, however, is positive if politically interested people use news sites more and spend more time on reading newspapers. In this scenario, the negative effect of news site use on newspaper reading is estimated too low if we do not control for political interest.

```{block2, type='rmdimportant'}
A variable is a suppressor (1) if it is not included in the regression model but (2) an effect would become stronger if the variable is included in the model.
```

Suppression can have surprising effects. If the predictor's original effect was close to zero, adding a suppressor variable to the model will strengthen the effect. An effect that we initially believed to be absent may turn out to be substantial and statistically significant. If our regression model tells us that our predictor does not have an effect, we cannot rule out that it does have an effect that is suppressed by a suppressor variable.

Finally, indirect correlations due to other predictors can add so much to the original partial effect of a predictor that the standardized regression coefficient becomes higher than 1 or lower than -1. This clearly illustrates that standardized regression coefficients are not correlations in multiple regression models because correlations can never be higher than 1 or lower than -1. In contrast, the standardized regression coefficient in a simple regression model is equal to the correlation between predictor and outcome. This is another important difference between simple and multiple regression models.

### Reinforcement and spuriousness {#spuriousness}

Adding a new predictor to a regression model may weaken the effects of other predictors or even change the direction of effects. This happens if the indirect correlation due to a confounder has the same direction (sign) as the regression effect of the predictor in the model without the confounder. Either the indirect correlation and regression effect are both positive or they are both negative.

In both situations, regression effects are initially overestimated because the predictors cover part of the effect of an important variable that has not yet been added to the regression model. The part of the effect that is due to the confounding variable is called _spurious_. The confounding variable is called a _reinforcer_ because it makes an effect appear stronger than it really is as long as the confounder has not been added to the regression model.

As an example, the effect of political interest on newspaper reading time may include the effect of age on newspaper reading. If older people are more interested in politics and do more newspaper reading, age creates a positive indirect correlation between political interest and newspaper reading. 

If age is not included as a predictor in the regression model, the indirect correlation is mistakenly attributed to the effect of interest in politics. The estimated effect is too strong. Once we include age as a predictor, the effect of political interest is cleansed of the age effect, so the effect size decreases.

In Figure \@ref(fig:reinforcement1), age is positively correlated with both political interest and newspaper reading. But a confounder that is negatively correlated with predictor and outcome has the same impact as a confounder that is positively correlated with predictor and outcome. Political cynicism, for instance, can be negatively correlated with both interest in politics and newspaper reading. Similar scenarios are available if the regression effect is negative.

```{r reinforcement2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Political cynicism as a confounder of the effect of interest in politics on newspaper reading time.", fig.asp=0.3}
library(ggplot2)
# Create coordinates for the variable names.
variables <- data.frame(x = c(0.3, 0.38, 0.5, 0.62, 0.7, 0.5), 
                        y = c(.1, .2, .3, .2, .1, .1),
                        label = c("Pol.Interest", "-", "Pol.Cynicism", "-", "Reading Time", "+"))
ggplot(variables, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = variables$x[1], y = variables$y[1], xend = variables$x[5] - 0.06, yend = variables$y[1]), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.04, "npc"), type = "closed")) +

As with suppression, spuriousness can have surprising results. It may happen that the entire estimated effect of a predictor is spurious. Adding a reinforcer variable to the regression model may make the entire effect of a predictor disappear. In other words, an effect that we initially thought was substantial may turn out to be too weak to be of interest.

Actually, the indirect correlation between a predictor and dependent variable due to a confounding variable can be so strong that a positive effect in a model without the confounder changes into a negative effect in a model that includes the variable. Adding the reinforcer to the model, the effect of the predictor not only moves towards zero (becoming weaker), but it moves beyond zero into a negative effect. It may even move so far beyond zero that the new negative effect is stronger than reinforced positive effect.

The opposite may happen as well: A formerly negative effect may become positive if a strong positive reinforcer variable is added to the model. If political interest actually has a negative effect on reading time but the indirect correlation via age is strongly positive, leaving age out of the model may give the impression that political interest has a positive effect. 

```{block2, type='rmdimportant'}
A variable is a reinforcer (1) if it is not included in the regression model but (2) an effect would become weaker or change sign if the variable is included in the model.
```

To summarize the two types of confounders:

```{block2, type='rmdimportant'}
* If we add a *suppressor* to the model, the suppressed effect moves away from zero. A positive effect becomes more strongly positive, a negative effect becomes more strongly negative.

* If we add a *reinforcer* to the model, the reinforced effect moves towards the opposite side. A positive effect becomes less strongly positive or even negative and a negative effect becomes less strongly negative or even positive.
```

The bottom line is simple: We can only trust the results of regression analysis if all important confounders are included in the model.

Answer to Question 1. 

* Note that the simple effect is the regression coefficient if we do not
control for any confounders, so political interest is the only predictor. The
partial effect is the regression coefficient for the effect of political
interest on reading time if we control for (at least) one other predictor.
Then, political interest is not the only predictor in the regression model.
* If the indirect correlation has the opposite sign of the direct effect of
political interest on reading time, which is positive here, the partial effect
is stronger than the simple effect. An indirect correlation is negative if one
of its two correlations is negative and the other is positive.
* If the indirect correlation has the same sign as the direct effect of
political interest on reading time, the partial effect is weaker than the
simple effect. An indirect correlation is positive if none or both of its two
correlations are negative.
* Note that we compare the signs of the correlations of the confounder with
the sign of the predictor in the model without the confounder. A variable is
no longer a confounder if it is included in the model. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.3.1)

Answer to Exercise 2. 

* If the partial effect of a predictor increases (becomes more strongly
positive or more strongly negative) when a new predictor is added to the
regression model, the added predictor was a suppressor while it was not yet
included in the model.
* When age is added as a predictor to the model, none of the partial effects
of other predictors increases, so age did not suppress any of the effects in
the models that did not include age yet.
  
* If the partial effect of a predictor decreases (becomes less strongly
positive or less strongly negative) or it changes sign when a new predictor is
added to the regression model, the added predictor was a reinforcer while it
was not yet included in the model.
* This happens to the partial effects of education, interest in politics, and
news site use when age is added as a predictor. For these three predictors,
age was a reinforcer. Part of their effects were spurious in the models

### Criteria for a causal relation {#causalcriteria}
Researchers are usually interested in causal effects, so let us theorize a causal order between age and reading newspapers. From previous research and personal experience, we strongly suspect that older people spend more time on reading newspapers than young people. In statistical language, we expect a positive correlation between age and newspaper reading time. Can age be a cause of current newspaper reading?

Correlation is the first criterion. A causal relation implies correlation or another type of statistical association. If newspaper reading is not correlated with age, it is hard to imagine that age affects newspaper reading. But correlation does not imply causation, as the saying goes. Correlated variables need not be causally related. We need additional arguments to add plausibility to a causal relation.

The second criterion is the time order between cause and consequence. A cause must appear before the consequence. In our example, a person's age must be fixed before she displays the behaviour that we want to explain, namely reading newspapers. The time order is very plausible here because age stands for the moment a person was born, which must be prior in time to reading newspapers. If there is a causal relation between age and reading newspapers, age must be the cause and newspaper reading the consequence.

A third criterion for causality is that the correlation is not spurious. In Section \@ref(spuriousness), we have encountered a spurious effect as an effect that incorrectly includes the effect of a confounder (reinforcer).

In the context of causality, spuriousness is linked to a confounder that is a _common cause_ to both the assumed cause (predictor) and consequence (dependent variable). Age, for instance, can be a common cause both to having (grand)children and reading newspapers. Older people tend to have more (grand)children and they read more newspapers. If we do not control for age when we regress newspaper reading time on the number of (grand)children a person has, we may find a positive effect.

This effect is probably not causal: We do not spend more time reading newspapers because we have more (grand)children. Unless we use newspaper reading to ignore our children and grandchildren when they are around. Most if not all of the effect of (grand)children on newspaper reading is spurious because it results from a common cause, namely age or the habits and opportunities represented by age.

To interpret the effect that we find as causal, then, we must ensure that there are no confounding variables that are common causes to both our predictors and dependent variable. Including them as controls in the regression model is a way to solve the problem. Unfortunately, we can never be sure that we have included all common causes in our model.

### Mediation as indirect effect {#indirecteffect}

A common cause need not remove the entire effect between a predictor and dependent variable. Even if part of newspaper reading is caused by age, another part can be caused by a variable related to age, for example, interest in politics. During their lifetime, people may gain more experience with politics and, for that reason, become more interested in reading about politics. This may cause them to invest more time in reading newspapers for collecting information.

Not all people become more interested in politics as they grow older and their interest in politics need not increase regularly during all of their lifetime. The relation between age and interest in politics, therefore, will not be perfect. This allows us to technically distinguish between the effect of age and the effect of interest in politics.

If we include both age and interest in politics as predictors in a regression model for newspaper reading time, the partial effect of interest in politics is corrected for the spurious correlation between interest in politics and newspaper reading caused by age as their common cause. The partial effect of political interest can be interpreted as causal if current interest in politics was attained before the newspaper readings that we measure (very plausible) and age is the only common cause of interest in politics and newspaper reading (highly questionable).

```{r causaldiagram, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Causal diagram for the effects of age and interest in politics on newspaper reading time.", fig.asp=0.3}
library(ggplot2)
# Create coordinates for the variable names.
variables <- data.frame(x = c(0.3, 0.5, 0.7),

                        label = c("Age", "Pol.Interest", "Reading Time"))
ggplot(variables, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = variables$x[1], y = variables$y[1], xend = variables$x[3] - 0.06, yend = variables$y[1]), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.04, "npc"), type = "closed")) +

  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0.2, 0.8), ylim = c(0, 0.4)) +
  theme_void()
# Cleanup.
rm(variables)
```

Now let us draw the _causal diagram_ for this simple example (Figure \@ref(fig:causaldiagram)). A causal diagram contains the names of the variables with arrows pointing from causes to consequences. The causal order of variables is represented from left to right. In Figure \@ref(fig:causaldiagram), the very first cause (age) is at the left, the final consequence (newspaper reading time) is at the right, and interest in politics is placed in the middle. In this layout, the arrows always point to the right.

In the causal order that we theorize, age is causally prior or _antecedent_ to interest in politics, which is antecedent to current newspaper reading time. We have an _indirect effect_ of age on newspaper reading by way of interest in politics. When adults grow older, they tend to be more interested in politics and because of this, they tend to spend more time on reading newspapers. We say that interest in politics _mediates_ the effect of age on newspaper reading time. Interest in politics is a _mediator_, an _intermediary variable_, or an _intervening variable_ in this causal diagram.

A causal diagram like Figure \@ref(fig:causaldiagram) is also called a _path diagram_. Each indirect effect is a sequence of direct effects. Each direct effect is a "step" from one variable to another variable, represented by an arrow. An indirect effect, then, can be regarded as a _path_ that we can follow to "travel" from one variable to another variable. 

```{r causaldiagram2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Causal diagram for the effect of age on newspaper reading time mediated by interest in politics and news site use.", fig.asp=0.3}
library(ggplot2)
# Create coordinates for the variable names.
variables <- data.frame(x = c(0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8), 
                        y = c(.1, .3, .3, .1),
                        label = c("Age", "Pol.Interest", "News Site Use", "Reading Time"))
ggplot(variables, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = variables$x[1], y = variables$y[1], xend = variables$x[4] - 0.07, yend = variables$y[1]), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.04, "npc"), type = "closed")) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = variables$x[1], y = variables$y[1], xend = variables$x[2] - 0.04, yend = variables$y[2] - 0.04), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.04, "npc"), type = "closed")) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = variables$x[2], y = variables$y[2], xend = variables$x[3] - 0.07, yend = variables$y[3]), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.04, "npc"), type = "closed")) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = variables$x[3], y = variables$y[3], xend = variables$x[4] - 0.04, yend = variables$y[4] + 0.04), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.04, "npc"), type = "closed")) + 
  geom_label(aes(label=label)) + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0.1, 0.9), ylim = c(0, 0.4)) +
  theme_void()
# Cleanup.
rm(variables)
```

An indirect effect may contain more than one step or mediator. If we include news site use in the model (Figure \@ref(fig:causaldiagram2)), we would have an indirect effect from age to interest in politics to news site use and finally to newspaper reading time.

### Causal process

In our example (Figure \@ref(fig:causaldiagram2)), age has a direct effect on newspaper reading time. What does the direct effect mean? If we start thinking about why older people spend more time on reading newspapers, we soon realize that this is probably not some biological process. It is hard to believe that an ageing human body requires more newspaper reading time. The effect is more likely to be social.

In the middle of the 20th century, newspapers were among the most important sources of information. A person who was born and grew up in that period is accustomed to using newspapers as main information source. For later generations, however, news sites on the internet have become important sources of information. Newspapers being less important to them, they are less oriented and accustomed to reading newspapers.

This line of reasoning shows us two things. First, we discover that our common cause may actually represent different things. Age, for instance, refers to life experience in its effect on interest in politics. In contrast, it relates to the period of coming of age in its direct effect on newspaper reading time.

Our second discovery is that we usually look for mediators if we want to understand a direct effect. Date of birth affects exposure to people using newspapers as information sources, which affects the habit of reading newspapers, which finally affects the time spend on reading newspapers later on. Exposure and habit are mediators here. A direct effect of age on newspaper reading represents a causal process that may contain many intermediary steps. Adding mediators to our model is a way of getting more insight in the causal process.

Answer to Question 1. 

* Political interest is a mediator in this model because it is predicted by
age and, in turn, it predicts reading time.
* If we interpret the arrows as causal influence, age is antecedent to
political interest, which is antecedent to reading time.
* A mediator is also called an intermediary or intervening variable. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.5.1)

Answer to Question 2. 

* The curved arrow is the standardized indirect (predictive) effect of age on
reading time.
* It summarizes the assumed causal process that age influences political
interest, which influences reading time. For example, older people are more
interested in politics and because they are more interested in politics, they
spend more time on reading newspapers.
* Technically, the standardized indirect effect represents the predicted
difference (in standard deviations) of reading time that results from a
difference in political interest that results from a difference of one
standard deviation in age.
* An indirect effect is equal to the product of the direct effects, just like
an indirect correlation is the product of correlations. In the example, the
value of the indirect effect is indeed equal (within rounding error) to the
product of the effects of age on political interest and political interest on
reading time. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.5.2)

```{block2, type='rmdanswer'}
Answer to Question 3. 

* An effect of a predictor on an outcome is fully mediated if the indirect
effect via the mediator is equal to the overall correlation between the
predictor and the outcome. In other words, the correlation only represents the
indirect effect, so there cannot be a direct effect.
* Of course, it makes no sense to say that an effect is fully mediated if
there is no indirect effect (and no direct effect). So we must start with a
non-zero correlation between predictor and outcome.
* As a next step, we must select values for the correlation between predictor
(age) and mediator (political interest) and for the correlation between
mediator and outcome (reading time) such that their product (the indirect
correlation) is equal to the correlation between age and reading time. Use,
for instance, 0.3 for the correlation between age and reading time, 0.5 for the
correlation between age and political interest, and 0.6 for the correlation
between political interest and reading time. Note that 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.5.3)

Mediation or, more generally, path models can be estimated with a series of regression models. Every variable in the path diagram with at least one predictor (or incoming arrow) is a dependent variable, so for each of them, we estimate a regression model. The regression model contains all variables as predictors that may cause changes in the dependent variable. In other words, all variables that are causally antecedent to the outcome are used as predictors. In a well-designed causal diagram, all variables to the left of the outcome are antecedent to it.

In the path diagram displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:mediation-regression), we would regress newspaper reading time, the final dependent variable, on all other variables. As a next step, we would predict news site use as outcome from all variables except reading time. 

Note that we include education level as predictor of news site use and newspaper reading even if we did not draw a direct arrow. Education level is theorized to be causally prior to news use site, so it can have a direct effect. We hypothesized that it did not have a direct effect on news site use and reading time, so we omitted arrows in our hypothesized model. We must include education as a predictor to check that it does not have these direct effects.

A third regression model would predict political interest from education level and age. The final regression model predicts education level from age .

### Requirements
We can estimate mediation and path models with regression analysis if we meet the following requirements:

1. Each variable used as a dependent variable is numeric. This is a general requirement of a linear regression model. In a path diagram, it means that all mediators and dependent variables must be numeric.

    For detail lovers: Variables with only incoming arrows may be dichotomous but that requires logistic regression, which we do not discuss.

2. Each variable used as a predictor must be a numeric or dichotomous (dummy) variable. Again, this is a general requirement of regression models.

3. There are no causal feedback loops. Causality must work in one direction. It must be impossible to travel from a variable back to it while following the direction of the arrows. Note that it can be difficult to assign a causal order. For example, does political interest cause (low) political cynicism or the other way around? Or are they not causally related at all?

4. All regression models meet the assumptions for regression analysis. Check if the residuals are normally distributed, centered around zero for all levels of the predicted outcome scores, and that scores are predicted equally well at all outcome levels (see Section \@ref(regr-inference)).

### Size of indirect effects {#size-indirect-effects}

The regression results tell us the sizes and statistical significance of all direct effects on the dependent variable. Both unstandardized and standardized regression coefficients can be used to interpret effects in the usual way. But how do we obtain the size, confidence interval, and statistical significance of indirect effects?

The size of an indirect effect is calculated in exactly the same way as the size of indirect correlations (Section \@ref(indirectcorrelation)): Just multiply the size of direct effects. This can be done with either the standardized regression coefficients or the unstandardized regression coefficients.

```{r pathdiagram-unstandardized, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Path diagram with unstandardized effect sizes and their 95% confidence intervals.", screenshot.alt = "figures/pathdiagram-unstandardized.png"}
# Causal model/path diagram with unstandardized effect sizes (and 95% confidence intervals). All effects.
# Display network.
visNetwork(nodes, edges, width = "100%") %>% 
  visEdges(arrows = "to", font = list(size = 30)) %>% 
  visInteraction(dragNodes = TRUE)
rm(nodes, edges)
``` 

It may sound weird that we can multiply the unstandardized regression coefficients but it really works. In Figure \@ref(fig:pathdiagram-unstandardized), for instance, the unstandardized partial effect of age (measured in tens of years) on interest in politics is `r round(model_2$coefficients[2], digits=2)`. This means that an additional 10 years of life predict an average increase in interest in politics of `r round(model_2$coefficients[2], digits=2)`. 

In its turn, interest in politics has an unstandardized effect of `r round(model_4$coefficients[4], digits=2)` on reading time (in minutes). An additional unit of interest in politics predicts an average increase in reading time of `r round(model_4$coefficients[4], digits=2)` minutes.

Ten additional years of life only predict an increase of `r round(model_2$coefficients[2], digits=2)` in political interest, not a full unit increase. The predicted increase of `r round(model_2$coefficients[2], digits=2)` in political interest predicts `r round(model_2$coefficients[2], digits=2)` * `r round(model_4$coefficients[4], digits=2)` = `r round(model_2$coefficients[2] * model_4$coefficients[4], digits=2)` minutes of additional newspaper reading time.  As a result, an additional ten years of life predict `r round(model_2$coefficients[2], digits=2)` * `r round(model_4$coefficients[4], digits=2)` = `r round(model_2$coefficients[2] * model_4$coefficients[4], digits=2)` minutes of additional newspaper reading time as an indirect effect via political interest. 

Note that the indirect effect is interpreted in terms of the measurement units of the initial predictor (age in tens of years) and the final outcome (reading time in minutes): A difference in (tens of) years predicts a difference in reading time in minutes. As a consequence, we can directly compare unstandardized indirect effect sizes of different paths between the same predictor and outcome, as we will see in Section \@ref(partialfullmediation).

### Direction of indirect effects

Multiplication of direct effects assigns the right direction (positive or negative) to indirect effects. In the example above, age has a positive effect on interest in politics, which has a positive effect on newspaper reading time. If age goes up, interest in politics goes up and if interest in politics goes up, reading time increases. Thus, higher age is indirectly associated with more reading time through interest in politics: Plus times plus yields a plus.

If people with more interest in politics use news sites more frequently, there is a positive regression effect. If more news site use is associated with less newspaper reading (a negative effect), the indirect effect of interest in politics on reading time via news site use is negative. People with more interest in politics spend less time on reading newspapers because they use news sites more: Positive times negative yields a negative.

### Parallel and serial mediation {#partialserialmediation}

If the indirect effects of an antecedent variable on a dependent variable contain at most one mediator, we have _single mediation_ or _parallel mediation_. Figure \@ref(fig:mediationparallel) illustrates single and parallel mediation.

                        label = c("Age", "Pol.Interest", "Reading Time"))

If any of the indirect effects between an antecedent and dependent variable contains two or more mediators, we are dealing with serial mediation. Figure \@ref(fig:mediationserial) illustrates serial mediation. It contains an indirect effect from age on reading time with two mediators: Age > Political Interest > News Site Use > Reading Time. The distinction between parallel and serial mediation is relevant to the software (PROCESS) that we will use to estimate indirect and total effects (Section \@ref(SPSSPROCESS)).


```{r mediationserial, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Causal diagram for serial mediation.", fig.asp=0.3}
library(ggplot2)
# Create coordinates for the variable names.
variables <- data.frame(x = c(0.3, 0.45, 0.7, 0.55), 
                        y = c(.2, .3, .2, .1),
                        label = c("Age", "Pol.Interest", "Reading Time", "News Site Use"))
ggplot(variables, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = variables$x[1], y = variables$y[1], xend = variables$x[3] - 0.06, yend = variables$y[1]), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.04, "npc"), type = "closed")) +

Table \@ref(tab:age-indirect) lists all direct and indirect effects of age on newspaper reading time in Figure \@ref(fig:pathdiagram-unstandardized). We can trace eight different paths from age to newspaper reading time. For each path, we multiply the unstandardized effect sizes. 

The unstandardized indirect effects between the same predictor and outcome can be compared directly because they are all expressed in the same measurement units, namely the predicted change in the dependent variable (reading time in minutes) for a difference of one unit in the predictor (ten additional years of life) (Section \@ref(size-indirect-effects)). The unstandardized direct effect is also expressed as predicted change in reading time (minutes) for a difference in age (tens of years), so it can be compared to the indirect effects. In addition, we can sum the unstandardized direct and indirect effects to obtain the total unstandardized effect.

With this in mind, we see that the relation between age and newspaper reading time is dominated by the positive direct effect (_b_ = `r round(model_4$coefficients[2], digits=2)`) and the positive indirect effect via news site use (_b_ = `r round(model_3$coefficients[2]*model_4$coefficients[5], digits=2)`). The remaining indirect effects are relatively small as indirect effects usually are. 

Summing all effects, we obtain a _total effect_ of age on newspaper reading time around `r round(model_4$coefficients[2] + model_1$coefficients[2]*model_4$coefficients[3] + model_1$coefficients[2]*model_2$coefficients[3]*model_4$coefficients[4] + model_1$coefficients[2]*model_2$coefficients[3]*model_3$coefficients[4]*model_4$coefficients[5] + model_1$coefficients[2]*model_3$coefficients[3]*model_4$coefficients[5] + model_2$coefficients[2]*model_4$coefficients[4] + model_2$coefficients[2]*model_3$coefficients[4]*model_4$coefficients[5] + model_3$coefficients[2]*model_4$coefficients[5], digits=0)` (_b_ = `r round(model_4$coefficients[2] + model_1$coefficients[2]*model_4$coefficients[3] + model_1$coefficients[2]*model_2$coefficients[3]*model_4$coefficients[4] + model_1$coefficients[2]*model_2$coefficients[3]*model_3$coefficients[4]*model_4$coefficients[5] + model_1$coefficients[2]*model_3$coefficients[3]*model_4$coefficients[5] + model_2$coefficients[2]*model_4$coefficients[4] + model_2$coefficients[2]*model_3$coefficients[4]*model_4$coefficients[5] + model_3$coefficients[2]*model_4$coefficients[5], digits=2)`). A person who is ten years older but in other respects the same as another person, is predicted to spend on average `r round(model_4$coefficients[2] + model_1$coefficients[2]*model_4$coefficients[3] + model_1$coefficients[2]*model_2$coefficients[3]*model_4$coefficients[4] + model_1$coefficients[2]*model_2$coefficients[3]*model_3$coefficients[4]*model_4$coefficients[5] + model_1$coefficients[2]*model_3$coefficients[3]*model_4$coefficients[5] + model_2$coefficients[2]*model_4$coefficients[4] + model_2$coefficients[2]*model_3$coefficients[4]*model_4$coefficients[5] + model_3$coefficients[2]*model_4$coefficients[5], digits=0)` additional minutes on reading newspapers per day. 

If the direct effect of a predictor on the outcome is zero in a model with mediators, the predictor's effect is _fully mediated_. This clearly is not the case in our example: There still is a substantial direct effect of age on newspaper reading time. This is what we usually encounter; it is called _partial mediation_.

Sometimes, researchers decide that an effect is fully mediated if the direct effect is no longer statistically significant once a mediator is added to the model. This strategy is contestable because a statistically non-significant direct effect does not mean that the effect is absent (zero) in the population. It can be absent but it is much more likely to be present but just too small to be picked up by our significance test (see Chapter \@ref(crit-discus)).

The distinction between full and partial mediation is a little bit problematic. From a substantive point of view, we may argue that direct effects are probably always mediated. As we have seen in Section \@ref(indirecteffect), a direct effect usually summarizes a causal process that consists of intermediary steps, which is mediation. We may wonder whether it makes theoretical sense to talk about unmediated effects. Do we really believe that age can directly affect newspaper reading time?

If the variables that we entered in the model as mediators do not create any indirect effects, the direct effect is equal to the total effect. We may conclude that the direct effect is not mediated by the mediators that are included in the model. For example, if education, political interest, and news site use do not create indirect effects from age on newspaper reading time (Figure \@ref(fig:pathdiagram-unstandardized)), we only have the direct effect of age on reading time in our model. However, this effect is very likely to be mediated by other variables that we did not include in the model. We should not conclude that the effect is unmediated because we have not found mediation yet.

```

SPSS does not calculate the size of indirect effects for us or their confidence intervals and p values. It is easy to calculate the sizes of indirect effects, as we have seen in a preceding section: just take the product of direct effects. In contrast, it is not possible to calculate the confidence interval or p value of an indirect effect in a reliable way from the confidence intervals or p values of the direct effects [see @RefWorks:3873: Section 4.4 for a detailed discussion of different approaches].

For statistical inference on the indirect effect, we need the sampling distribution of the size of the indirect effect. This sampling distribution is not the same as the product or some other combination of the sampling distributions of the direct effects that make up the indirect effect. The situation is similar to the sampling distribution of the difference of two sample means (independent-samples t test), which is not equal to the difference between the sampling distribution of one mean and the sampling distribution of the other mean (Section \@ref(complicatedsampling)). 

We use bootstrapping to create the sampling distribution of the size of an indirect effect. We have learned the principles and limitations of bootstrapping in Section \@ref(boot-approx), so we need not go into details here. Suffice it to repeat that our original sample must not be too small and it must be quite representative of the population if we apply bootstrapping.

```{r indirect-sim, echo=FALSE}
# Example of bootstrapped CI and p value for the indirect effects of age via political interest and/or news site use on reading time, similar to output from PROCESS (Model 6 with 2 mediators).
results <- rbind(
  c("Total indirect effect", "1.47", ".42", ".62", "2.25"),
  c("Age - Pol. Interest - Reading Time", ".05", ".03", ".01", ".14"),
  c("Age - Pol. Interest - News Site Use - Reading Time", "-.02", ".01", "-.05", ".00"), 
  c("Age - News Site Use - Reading Time", "1.44", ".42", ".60", "2.23")
)

knitr::kable(results, booktabs = TRUE,
             caption = "Bootstrap results for unstandardized indirect effects in a model with two mediators. Effect size, standard error, lower and upper levels of the 95\\% confidence interval.", col.names = c("", "Effect", "Boot SE", "BootLLCI", "BootULCI"), align = c("l", "r", "r", "r", "r"))  %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 12, full_width = F,
                latex_options = c("scale_down", "HOLD_position"))

 # Cleanup.
rm(results)
```
 
The confidence interval of an indirect effect can be calculated from its bootstrapped sampling distribution. Table \@ref(tab:indirect-sim) shows bootstrap results for the indirect effects in a model with age as predictor, newspaper reading time as dependent variable, and interest in politics and news site use as mediators. 

In total, there is a substantial indirect effect of age on newspaper reading time in this model. We are confident that this effect is positive (_b_ = 1.47, 95%CI[0.62, 2.25]). It is easy to see that the indirect effect of age via news site use on reading time is by far the most important indirect effect. On its own, it is responsible for almost the entire total indirect effect (_b_ = 1.44, 95%CI[0.60, 2.23]).

It may happen that an indirect effect is not statistically significant (the confidence interval includes zero) whereas all direct effects that constitute the indirect effect are statistically significant. In Figure \@ref(fig:causaldiagram3), for example, both the effect of age on political interest (b = 0.30, 95%CI[0.22, 0.38]) and the effect of political interest on reading time (b = 0.20, 95%CI[0.12, 0.28]) are statistically significant at the .05 level. The indirect effect of age via political interest on reading time, however, is not statistically significant at this level (b = 0.30 * 0.20 = 0.06, 95%CI[-0.02, 0.14]). 

```{r causaldiagram3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Causal diagram for the effects of age and interest in politics on newspaper reading time: unstandardized estimates with 95% confidence intervals.", fig.asp=0.3}

This sounds like a paradox but it should not upset you. The unstandardized indirect effect tends to be weaker than the direct effects, that is, closer to zero (for instance, see Table \@ref(tab:age-indirect)). With a weaker effect, it is more difficult to reject the null hypothesis that the effect is zero in the population. We need a larger sample to reject null hypotheses for smaller effects (see Chapter \@ref(power) on power).

Answer to Question 1. 

* There are four variables with incoming arrows in this model. Each of them can
be a dependent variable in a regression model, so we can estimate four
regression models.
* The unstandardized and standardized regression coefficients tell us the
(unstandardized or standardized) sizes of the direct effects in the path
model.
* For example, news site use has an unstandardized effect of -1.55 on
newspaper reading time in the diagram. A difference of one unit of news site
use predicts a decrease in newspaper reading time of 1.55 units. We are 95
per cent confident that this decrease is in between 0.6 and 2.5 units in the
population. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.6.1)
```
  
<A name="answer9.6.2"></A>
```{block2, type='rmdanswer'}
Answer to Question 2. 

* If we do not include effects between variables that were not hypothesized in
our regression model, we actually assume that the effects are zero.
* If this assumption is not correct, the results for hypothesized effects are
wrong.
* If we exclude the effect of a predictor on an outcome from the model, we
deny this predictor the opportunity to be a common cause to the outcome and
another predictor. Thus, we fail to signal and filter out the spurious
correlation due to this common cause.
* It is better to include all causally antecedent variables as predictors. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.6.2)

<A name="answer9.6.3"></A>
```{block2, type='rmdanswer'}
Answer to Question 3. 

* SPSS does not report the sizes and confidence intervals of the indirect effects.
* Indirect effect sizes are easily calculated. Just multiply the regression
coefficients of all effects that make up the indirect effect.
* Confidence intervals and p values of indirect effects cannot be easily
calculated from the regression results. We use bootstrapping to this end. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.6.3)

<A name="answer9.6.4"></A>
```{block2, type='rmdanswer'}
Answer to Question 4. 

* For every sample, the indirect effect size is calculated as the product of
the effects of the predictor (Age) on the mediator (Political interest) and of
the mediator on the outcome (Reading time). The indirect effect is added to
the sampling distribution. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.6.4)

Answer to Question 5. 

* If you look carefully, you will see that the sampling distribution of the
regression coefficient of the indirect effect is skewed, asymmetrical. The
left tail is badly populated and the top is to the left of the top of
the normal curve. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.6.5)

## Controlling for Covariates

We usually have theoretical reasons to expect that a particular variable mediates an effect, for example, political interest mediates the effect of age on newspaper reading time. At the same time, we know that our dependent variable and perhaps our mediator may depend on other variables. Newspaper reading time, for instance, may also depend on education. In this situation, we would use the other variables as covariates (or control variables) for which we want to control statistically.

```{r causaldiagram4, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Causal diagram for  interest in politics as mediator between age and newspaper reading time with education as covariate.", fig.asp=0.3}
library(ggplot2)
# Create coordinates for the variable names.
variables <- data.frame(x = c(0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.3), 
                        y = c(.1, .3, .1, .3),
                        label = c("Age", "Pol.Interest", "Reading Time", "Education"))
ggplot(variables, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = variables$x[1], y = variables$y[1], xend = variables$x[3] - 0.06, yend = variables$y[1]), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.04, "npc"), type = "closed")) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = variables$x[1], y = variables$y[1], xend = variables$x[2] - 0.04, yend = variables$y[2] - 0.04), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.04, "npc"), type = "closed")) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = variables$x[2], y = variables$y[2], xend = variables$x[3] - 0.04, yend = variables$y[3] + 0.04), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.04, "npc"), type = "closed")) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = variables$x[4], y = variables$y[4], xend = variables$x[2] - 0.04, yend = variables$y[2]), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.04, "npc"), type = "closed")) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = variables$x[4], y = variables$y[4], xend = variables$x[3] - 0.06, yend = variables$y[3]), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.04, "npc"), type = "closed")) + 
  geom_label(aes(label=label)) + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0.2, 0.8), ylim = c(0, 0.4)) +
  theme_void()
# Cleanup.
rm(variables)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:causaldiagram4) presents a model in which education is used as a covariate in a model with political interest mediating the effect of age on newspaper reading time. Education is probably causally antecedent to both political interest and newspaper reading time, so it is allowed to have an effect on both variables. In this way, we control for education and remove spurious correlation between political interest and newspaper reading time due to education as a common cause.

If education is allowed to predict both political interest and newspaper reading time as in Figure \@ref(fig:causaldiagram4), political interest mediates the effect of education on newspaper reading time. We are, however, not interested in mediation in the case of a covariate, so we do not estimate or report the indirect effects of education on newspaper reading time. In the context of a mediation model, a _covariate_ is a predictor for which we do not investigate if its effect is mediated.

Note that covariates should only be allowed to have an effect on variables that can be caused by the covariate. We should not include effects of a covariate on a variable that is causally antecedent to it. If a covariate is a consequence rather than a cause of a mediator, it had better be used as another mediator in the model. If, for instance, political cynicism may affect newspaper reading time but it is a consequence of political interest, it should be included as a second (serial) mediator instead of as a covariate.

## Reporting Mediation Results

We analyse a path model as a series of regression models, so the general rules for reporting mediation are the same as for reporting regression analyses (see Section \@ref(reportmoderation)). If you summarize results in a table, make sure that the table includes:

1. The unstandardized regression coefficients for all direct and indirect effects tested in the regression models.

2. The confidence intervals and significance levels of the unstandardized effects.

3. The F test and measure of model fit ($R^2$) for each regression model.

```{r mediation-table, echo=FALSE}

A path model may yield a lot of direct effects, so it is good practice to present results as a path diagram with the values of the standardized or unstandardized regression coefficients as labels to the arrows. A path model conveniently summarizes the results for the reader (Figure \@ref(fig:results-pathdiagram)). Remember that we don't use standardized regression coefficients if the predictor or a covariate is dichotomous or a set of dummy variables (see Section \@ref(dichpredictor)).

If effect mediation is central to your report, focus your presentation and interpretation on the indirect effects and compare them to the direct effects. Report the size and confidence interval of each indirect effect. If possible, add both the direct and indirect effect to a diagram such as Figure \@ref(fig:results-pathdiagram). 

Interpret the indirect effect just like any regression effect, namely, as the predicted difference in the outcome for a one unit difference in the predictor. It is usually interesting to compare the sizes of the direct and indirect effects. Is the effect predominantly mediated in the model or is only a minor part of the effect mediated in the model?

Inform the reader that you bootstrapped the indirect effect and report the number of bootstrap samples and the method used for the confidence intervals (see Section \@ref(SPSSPROCESS)). For a more elaborate discussion of reporting mediation, see Hayes [-@RefWorks:3873: 198-202].

## Mediation with SPSS and PROCESS {#SPSSPROCESS}

###  Instructions

SPSS cannot apply statistical inference to indirect effects, so we use the PROCESS macro developed for this purpose [@RefWorks:3873]. If correctly installed (see below), the macro can be used from within the SPSS Regression menu. Please note that you had better not paste the PROCESS commands to the SPSS syntax because it produces a lot of code that is difficult to understand. Instead, run the PROCESS command directly from the menu and manually add a comment to your SPSS syntax file reminding yourself of the model that you estimated with PROCESS.

[Download the PROCESS macro](http://processmacro.org/download.html) and [install the SPSS custom dialog file](http://www.processmacro.org/uploads/3/4/8/5/34858384/dialoginstall.pdf). Check the [FAQ at the PROCESS website](http://processmacro.org/faq.html) if installation is not successful. If PROCESS is successfully installed, it can be found in the Analyze > Regression menu.

# Goal: Getting standardized direct effects and checking assumptions in SPSS, estimating a path model with both parallel and serial mediators in SPSS that cannot be estimated in PROCESS (two models with covariates)?.
# Example: readers.sav, the effect of age on newspaper reading time mediated by news site use and the effect of education mediated by both political interest (age -> educ -> pol.interest -> reading).
# SPSS menu: linear regression (multiple times).
# Interpret output: standardized regression coefficients as direct effect sizes (not in PROCESS).
# Check assumptions: for each regression model separately.

# Show how to use SPSS for mediation. Only use SPSS if there is both parallel and serial mediation. (Videos on regression in SPSS in CH. 8, and previously in Ch. 9.)

Check data:  
  
The variables do not have impossible values.  
  
Check assumptions:  
  
Regression model with newspaper reading time as dependent variable:  
  
* The residuals are quite normally distributed.  
* They are centered around zero at all levels of the predicted outcome, so a
linear model seems to fit the data.
* The variation in residuals is about the same at all levels of the predicted
outcome, so the outcome is more or less equally well predicted at all levels
of the dependent variable.
* As a conclusion, there are no clear indications that the assumptions for a
linear regression model are violated.
  
Regression model with news site use as dependent variable:  
  
* The residuals are quite normally distributed but they display a pattern of
down-sloping strips. This is the consequence of the fact that the outcome
(news site use) is measured as integer scores, that is, without decimal
places. So this pattern is nothing to worry about.
* Check that the residuals are evenly distributed above and below zero for all
predicted outcome levels and that the variation is more or less equal for all
predicted outcome levels. Because the residuals are organized in strips, the
variation cannot be as large at the extreme right or extreme left as in the
middle. But we may assume that this results from the discrete (integer)
dependent variable instead of from a problem with homoscedasticity.

Answer to Exercise 2. 

SPSS syntax:  
  
We should not paste PROCESS commands because they contain a lot of
unintelligble code.
  
In the PROCESS menu:  
    
* Select readingtime as dependent variable (Y variable).  
* Select age as independent variable (X variable),  
* Select newssite as mediator (M),  
* Select 4 under Model number (model with only one mediator).  
* Under Options: Select Effect size (for standardized effect sizes) 
  and 3 decimal places in output.
  
Check data: See Exercise 1.  
  
Check assumptions: Cannot be done with PROCESS, must be done with SPSS. See
Exercise 1.
  
Interpret the results:  
  
The relevant results in the PROCESS output:  
    
Indirect effect of X on Y  

| | Effect | Boot SE | BootLLCI | BootULCI |
|:----|----:|----:|----:|----:|
| newssite | 1.121 | .411 | .307 | 1.923 |

Completely standardized indirect effect of X on Y   

| | Effect | Boot SE | BootLLCI | BootULCI |
|:----|----:|----:|----:|----:|
| newssite | .164 | .060 | .045 | .281 |

Note that these are bootstrap results, so they may change from
one analysis to the next. Your results are most likely to be
not exactly the same as the ones reported here.
  
* An age difference of ten years (remember that age was measured in decades)
increases the predicted average newspaper reading time through news site use
with slightly more than one minute. With 95% confidence, the increase is 0.3
and 1.9 additional minutes.
* The indirect effect is weak to moderate, *b\** = .16, 95%CI[.05; .28]. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.9.2)

Answer to Exercise 3. 

SPSS syntax:  
  
* Again, we should not paste PROCESS commands because they contain a lot of
unintelligble code.
  
In addition to the PROCESS menu selections specified in Exercise 2, you should:  
  
* Select interest in politics under Covariate(s).
  
Check data: See Exercise 1.  
  
Check assumptions: Cannot be done with PROCESS, must be done with SPSS. See
Exercise 1.
  
Interpret the results:  
  
* PROCESS assumes that covariates predict both the mediator(s) and the
dependent variable. You can see this in the reported regression equations: all
of them include the covariates as predictors.
* If you think that political interest is consequent to news site use instead
of antecedent, political interest should be included as a (second) mediator
between news site use and reading time. In this case, you should estimate a
model for serial mediation, see Exercise 4.
  
The relevant results in the PROCESS output:  
  
Indirect effect of X on Y   

| | Effect | Boot SE | BootLLCI | BootULCI |
|:----|----:|----:|----:|----:|
| newssite | 1.441   |  .416     |  .589      |  2.225 |

Completely standardized indirect effect of X on Y

|:----|----:|----:|----:|----:|
| newssite | .212    |  .061     |  .087      |  .325 |

* The interpretation is very much like the interpretation in Exercise 2. Note
that the indirect effect has become a little stronger now that we control for
interest in politics. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.9.3)

Answer to Exercise 4. 

SPSS syntax:  
  
* Remember, we should not paste PROCESS commands because they contain a lot of
unintelligble code.
  
In addition to the PROCESS menu selections specified in Exercise 2, you should:  
    
* Add political interest to the list of mediators (M) ensuring that it is the
first in this list.
* Change Model number to 6 (Model with two mediators in line).  
  
Check data: See Exercise 1.  
  
Check assumptions: Cannot be done with PROCESS, must be done with SPSS. See
Exercise 1.
  
Interpret the results:  
  
The main results are reported thus:  
  
Indirect effect(s) of X on Y   
  
|        |  Effect  |  Boot SE  |  BootLLCI  |  BootULCI  |

* Age has an indirect effect on newspaper reading time. An additional ten
years of life predict that newspaper reading time increases by 1.5 minutes on
average.
* The indirect effect mainly consists of an effect via news site use. Indirect
effects including interest in politics are much weaker.
* The indirect effect through interest in politics is probably positive
whereas the effect through political interest and news site use is probably
negative. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.9.4)

## Criticisms of Mediation

If we think of causality, we usually think of a process in which one thing leads to another thing, which leads to something else, and so on. This is apparent if we want to explain why we think that one phenomenon causes another (see Section \@ref(indirecteffect)). Mediation, however, is difficult to establish with regression analysis and, as some argue, perhaps impossible to establish.

### Causal order assumed
It is paramount to note that the regression approach to mediation and path models does not tell us anything about the causal order of the variables. The causal order is purely an assumption that we make. The plausibility of the assumptions depends on how well we can justify the time order of the variables and the absence of common causes for cause-consequence pairs (see \@ref(causalcriteria)).

### Time order
To establish the time order of variables, we must think about the time at which the behaviours or opinions that we measure took place. This is what matters, not the time at which we measure them. We can collect information on behaviour a long time after the fact, for example by asking respondents when they started using news sites or checking internet use logs.

The more time has passed between the occurrence of the behaviour or opinion that we think is the cause and the occurrence of the one we think is the consequence, the more plausible the causal order. If cause and consequence appear very close in time, it may be difficult to argue that one variable precedes the other. 

### Causality or underlying construct?
For causes and consequences that appear nearly simultaneously, we should take into account that the two variables may measure the same underlying construct. Think of the way we construct a scale from items: We assume that the items measure the same underlying attitude, for instance, interest in politics. 

The indicators of a scale are correlated because they have a common cause, namely, the underlying attitude. But it does not make sense to interpret the correlation as a sign of mediation. One item does not trigger another item, and so on. A mediator must be theoretically and conceptually different from both the predictor and outcome. We have to provide arguments that they are really different.

An underlying construct such as an attitude is just one example of a common cause that undermines the conclusion that an effect is mediated. Any common cause of a predictor and mediator or of a mediator and dependent variable that is not included in the model renders all or part of the correlations spurious, that is, non-causal. If we doubt the causality of any effect in the path constituting the indirect effect, we must doubt the causality of the indirect effect as well. Without causality, there is no mediation. So we should think hard about common causes and include them in our model.

### Statistical control is not experimental control
In a strict interpretation, mediation cannot be established with regression models. To understand this, let us look very carefully at the statistical meaning of direct and indirect effects. 

A _direct effect_ of age on newspaper reading time refers to changes in reading time that depend on changes in age but not on changes in the mediator, for instance, interest in politics. Strictly speaking, a person's age should change and this person's interest in politics should not change to detect the direct effect of age on reading time. But interest in politics depends on age if it mediates the effect of age, so it tends to change if age changes. That is a problem.

In an experiment, we would have to manipulate the value of the mediator to ensure that it does not change. If we succeed in doing this, which is difficult to imagine, the effect of the predictor on the dependent variable is really a direct effect, at least within the model. For example, interest in politics is manipulated to be the same for some participants. Then, a change in newspaper reading time due to age change would indeed represent the direct effect for these participants. 

Controlling the effect of a predictor on the dependent variable for the mediator in a regression model, however, is not the same as experimental control as described above. In a regression model, the mediator values vary among persons. The statistical trick is that we only compare people who have the same mediator score when we calculate the direct effect. But even for these people, the effect of the predictor on the mediator may have done it's work: Their actual interest in politics is affected by their age. As a result, the effect of age on newspaper reading time includes an effect of age on interest in politics, so the mediator (interest in politics) is not completely excluded from the direct effect.

### Recommendations
All in all, mediation is an intuitively simple and appealing concept. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to substantiate the claim that indirect effects in path models represent mediation. Mediation assumes causal effects and causality is difficult to establish. 

If you plan to investigate mediation:

1. Justify that the mediator is theoretically and conceptually different from the predictor and outcome.

2. Motivate the time order of variables in the model.

3. Include variables that can be common causes to predictor, mediator, or outcome in your research project and in the regression models that you are going to estimate.

## Combining Mediation and Moderation

Mediation and moderation (Chapter \@ref(moderation)) can occur in the same model. For example, the effect of age on newspaper reading time mediated by interest in politics can be different for females and males. In other words, the indirect effect is different for females and males.

If the indirect effect is different for females and males, at least one of the two direct effects (predictor on mediator or mediator on dependent variable) must be different for females and males. This direct effect is moderated and as a consequence, indirect effects including this effect are moderated. This is called _moderated mediation_. In the example, sex is the moderator and interest in politics is the mediator of the indirect effect of age on newspaper reading time.

Several models with more than one mediator or with moderated mediation can be estimated with PROCESS. For an overview of the models, see Appendix A in Hayes [-@RefWorks:3873]. The models, however, are quite complex, so we leave them for enthusiasts.

Answer to Question 1. 

* The curved arrow is the standardized indirect (predictive) effect of age on
reading time. It represents the predicted change (in standard deviations) of
reading time that results from a change in political interest that results
from a change of one standard deviation in age.
* To obtain the value of the indirect standardized effect, multiply the
standardized effect of age on political interest by the standardized effect of
political interest on reading time. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.12.1)
```

<A name="answer9.12.2"></A>
```{block2, type='rmdanswer', echo=ch9}
Answer to Question 2. 

* If age is removed from the model, the standardized effect of political
interest on newspaper reading time is equal to the correlation between these
two variables. We would have a simple regression model with one predictor. So
we can use the correlation between political interest and newspaper reading
time as the standardized effect in a model without age.
* If the standardized regression effect of political interest on newspaper
reading time is higher than the correlation, age suppresses the effect. If we
exclude age from the model, the regression effect drops, so it is partly
suppressed.
* If the standardized regression effect of political interest on newspaper
reading time is lower than the correlation, age reinforces the effect. If we
exclude age from the model, the regression effect increases, so it is partly
reinforced.
* If age is not a common cause of political interest and newspaper reading
time, age is neither a suppressor nor a reinfocer, so it does not confound the
effect of political interest on newspaper reading time.
* Age is not a common cause if it has no effect on political interest or on
reading time in this model. In other words, if at least one of the two arrows
emanating from age is zero (absent).
* It is easy to set the effect of age on political interest to zero: Just set
this correlation to zero. Now, there is no indirect effect of the predictor on
the dependent variable via the mediator. As a result, no part of the
correlation between mediator and dependent variable can be due to the indirect
effect of the predictor. The mediator is responsible for the full correlation
between mediator and dependent variable, so its standardized regression
coefficient is equal to its correlation with the dependent variable.
* It is more difficult to find the value of the correlation between age and
reading time that makes the regression effect zero. This effect is zero if the
correlation between age and reading time is for 100% an indirect effect via
political interest. In that case, there cannot be a direct effect (there is
full mediation).
* So adjust the correlation between age and political interest and the
correlation between political interest and reading time such that their
product (the indirect effect size) equals the correlation between age and
reading time. Now, the regression effect of age on reading time is zero and
the regression coefficient for the effect of political interest on reading
time is equal to the correlation between these two variables. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.12.2)

<A name="answer9.12.3"></A>
```{block2, type='rmdanswer', echo=ch9}
Answer to Question 3. 

* The correlation between political interest and reading time is completely
spurious in this model if the entire correlation is due to a common cause.
* The indirect correlation created by a common cause is equal to the product
of the correlations between, on the one hand, the common cause (here: age)
and, on the other hand, the other two variables (political interest and
reading time).
* The correlation between political interest and reading time, then, is
completely spurious in this model if this correlation equals the product of
the correlations with age.
*Check this by adjusting the three correlations until the correlation between
political interest and reading time equals the product of the other two
correlations. Set, for instance, the correlation between political interest and
reading time to 0.1, the correlation between age and political interest to 0.4
and the correlation between age and reading time to 0.25. Note that 0.4 * 0.25
= 0.1.
* In the plot, the standardized regression coefficient for the effect of
political interest on reading time (b~MO~) should become zero. There is no
effect if we control for age even though the correlation is 0.1.
* Note that the standardized regression effect of political interest on
reading time need not be zero if the correlation between these two variables
is zero. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.12.3)

Answer to Question 4. 

* We must estimate a regression model for each variable that has at least one
predictor in the model.
* So we need two regression models: one with newspaper reading time as
dependent variable and the other with political interest as dependent
variable. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.12.4)

Answer to the Extra Question. 

* If age would be a strong suppressor of the effect of political interest on
reading time, including age in the model terminates the suppression, so the
partial effect of political interest on reading time becomes more strongly
positive or more strongly negative. It may become larger than 1.0 or smaller
than -1.0.
* You can create a strong suppression effect by selecting high correlations
between age and reading time, and between age and political interest. Ensure
that the effect direction (sign) is the opposite of the sign of the effect of
political interest on reading time.
* If the correlation between political interest and reading time is positive,
age suppresses the regression if the indirect correlation between political
interest due to age with reading time is negative. So. one of the correlations
of age with political interest and reading time must be positive, the other
must be negative. Just increase the size of the positive and negative
correlations to obtain a standardized regression coefficient for the effect of
political interest on reading time well above one.
* If the correlation between political interest on reading time is negative,
age suppresses the regression if the indirect correlation between political
interest due to age on reading time is positive. Make both the correlation
between age and reading time and the correlation between age and political
interest positive or negative. The standardized regression effect of political
interest on reading time will become more strongly negative than its
correlation. Again make the correlations stronger to obtain a standardized
regression coefficient for the effect of political interest on reading time
well below minus one. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.12.extra)

## Take-Home Points  

* In a multiple regression model, a regression coefficient represents the (predictive) effect of a variable while controlling for the effects of all other predictors. It is called a _partial effect_: the predictions of the dependent variable that cannot be predicted by the other predictors.

* If a new predictor is added to a regression model, the regression coefficient of an old predictor changes if the new predictor is correlated with both the old predictor and the dependent variable. If the old predictor's effect becomes stronger, the new predictor was a suppressor. If it becomes weaker (the old effect was---partially---spurious) or changes direction (sign), the new predictor was a reinforcer.

* An estimated regression coefficient only shows the true effect of a predictor if all suppressors and reinforcers are included in the model.

* A causal or path model without causal feedback loops can be estimated as a series of regression models: one regression model for each variable that has at least one predictor in the path model.

* Unstandardized regression coefficients, standardized regression coefficients, and correlations can be multiplied to obtain indirect effects and indirect correlations.

* An indirect effect is a mediated effect. Variables that are at the same time predicted and predictors in an indirect effect are called _mediators_, _intermediary variables_, or _intervening variables_.

* Statistical inference on an indirect effect---its confidence interval and significance level---requires a sampling distribution of the size of the indirect effect. This distribution can be bootstrapped with the PROCESS macro [@RefWorks:3873].

* Mediation is an intuitively appealing concept but it is difficult to establish. A causal interpretation requires a clear time order between predictor, mediator, and dependent variable, a clear theoretical and conceptual difference between these three variables, and the inclusion of all common causes of predictor, mediator, and dependent variable in the regression models.

Read the little but very helpful book on the logic of causal order by James A. Davis [-@RefWorks:1494] for more information on causality and correlational analysis.
