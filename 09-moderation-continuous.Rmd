### Summary {.unnumbered}

```{block2, type='rmdimportant'}
My moderator is numerical. How can I construct different regression lines for different moderator values?
```

Chapter \@ref(moderationcat) shows us how we can include dichotomous and categorical variables as predictors and moderators in a regression model. Using dummy variables, we can analyze mean differences between groups and we can construct different regression lines for different groups (moderation). A graph showing the different regression models for different moderator groups communicates the results of a moderation model in an attractive way.

What if our moderator is not dichotomous or categorical but numerical? For example, the effect of exposure to an anti-smoking campaign on attitude towards smoking can be different for people of different age or for people who spend more time with smokers.

We can include a numerical moderator in a regression model just like a dichotomous moderator. Add the predictor, the moderator, and an interaction variable, which is the product of the moderator and the predictor. If both the predictor and moderator are numerical, the interaction variable is numerical. It gives us numbers, not groups.

The interpretation of an interaction effect is different if the moderator is numerical instead of dichotomous or categorical. In general, the regression coefficient of a numerical variable expresses the effect of a one unit change. For a numerical predictor, this is the predicted change in the dependent variable. For a numerical moderator, however, it is the predicted change in the effect of the predictor. The unstandardized regression coefficient for a numerical moderator, then, tells us the predicted change in the effect of the predictor for a one unit increase in the moderator.

This interpretation is quite abstract and not easy to understand. It is better to visualize the regression lines for different values of the moderator. We usually draw regression lines for three interesting moderator values. The mean value of the moderator shows us the effect at a medium level of the moderator. One standard deviation below or above the mean of the moderator represent attractive low and high moderator values.

Just like a model with a dichotomous or categorical moderator, the effect of a predictor that is involved in moderation is a conditional effect. In other words, it is the effect for one particular value of the moderator, namely the value zero. Unfortunately, zero is not always a meaningful value for the moderator. If it does not exist or appears rarely on the moderator, it is better to mean-center the moderator. Mean-centering a variable changes the scores such that the mean of the original variable becomes zero on the mean-centered variable. The value zero is always meaningful for a mean-centered variable because it represents the mean score on the original variable. With a mean-centered moderator, the regression coefficient of the predictor always makes sense.

#### Essential Analytics {.unnumbered}

As in Chapter \@ref(moderationcat), we calculate an interaction variable as the product of the predictor and moderator (the *Compute Variable* option in the *Transform* menu) and we use it as one of the independent variables in a linear regression model (the *Linear* option in the *Regression* submenu).

The regression coefficient of the predictor tells us how much the predicted value of the dependent variable changes for a one unit increase in the predictor score **for cases that score zero on the moderator**. For example, one additional unit of exposure to the campaign decreases the attitude towards smoking by (-)0.53 for people with zero contacts with smokers (Figure \@ref(fig:meancentertable), red box). The cases that score zero on the moderator (here: people with zero contacts with smokers) are the reference group; zero is the reference value.

```{r meancentertable, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.pos='H', fig.align='center', fig.cap="SPSS table of regression effects for a model in which the effect of exposure is moderated by contact with smokers: with the original variables (left) and with the moderator mean-centered (right)."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/S9_AE1.png")
```

It is wise to mean-center the moderator variable before we use it. To mean-center a variable, we first obtain the value of the variable's mean with the *Statistics* option in the *Frequencies* submenu of *Descriptive Statistics*. Next, we use the *Compute Variable* option in the *Transform* menu to subtract this mean from the original variable.

The effect of exposure on attitude changes if we mean-center the moderator variable *contact* (Figure \@ref(fig:meancentertable), green box). People with an average number of contacts with smokers score zero on the mean-centered variable, so they are the new reference group. Among people with an average number of contacts with smokers, one additional unit of exposure decreases the predicted attitude by (-)0.31.

The regression coefficient of the interaction effect (Figure \@ref(fig:meancentertable), blue box) tells us how much the effect of the predictor changes if the moderator increases by one unit. One additional contact with a smoker increases the effect of exposure on attitude by 0.04, making it 0.04 less strongly negative or more strongly positive.

Communicate the results of a numerical moderator in a scatterplot (*Scatter/Dot* in the *Legacy Dialogs* submenu of the *Graphs* menu) with regression lines for the effect of the predictor at three moderator values: the mean value of the moderator, one standard deviation below the mean and one standard deviation above the mean (Figure \@ref(fig:nummoderatorplot)). Get the mean and standard deviation of the moderator variable with the *Statistics* option in the *Frequencies* submenu of *Descriptive Statistics* and plug these values in the regression equation along with suitable values of any covariates. Add the resulting (simple) regression equations to the scatterplot with the *Reference Line from Equation* option in the *Options* menu of the  *Chart Editor*.

```

## A Numerical Moderator {#cont-moderator-regression}

With a categorical moderator, it is quite obvious for which values of the moderator we are going to calculate and depict the effect of the predictor on the dependent variable. If smoking status moderates the effect of exposure on attitude towards smoking, we will inspect a regression line for each smoking status category: smokers, former smokers, and non-smokers. But what if the moderator is a numerical variable, for example, the intensity of contact with smokers?

```{r continuous-moderator, fig.pos='H', fig.align='center', fig.cap="How do contact values affect the conditional effect of exposure on attitude?", echo=FALSE, screenshot.opts = list(delay = 5), dev="png", out.width="775px"}

Add slider allowing the user to change the moderator value (range [0, 10], initial value 0). Replace the previous regression line by a grey line, remove older regression lines, and add new regression line in black; also update regression equation.

```

People hanging around a lot with smokers may have a more positive attitude towards smoking than people who have little contact with smokers. If people whose company you value are smokers, you are less likely to condemn smoking. This is an overall effect of contact with smokers on attitude towards smoking.

In addition, the anti-smoking campaign may be less effective for people who spend a lot of time with smokers. The attitude towards smoking may be stronger among people who spend more time with smokers, so it is more difficult to change the attitude. In this situation, contact with smokers decreases the effect of campaign exposure on attitude. The effect of exposure is moderated by contact with smokers.

Our moderator, contact with smokers, is numerical. As a consequence, we can have an endless number of contact levels as groups for which the slope may change. This is the only difference with a categorical moderator. Other than that, we will analyze a numerical moderator in the same way as we analyzed a categorical moderator.

### Interaction variable {#interpret-cont-interaction}

We need one interaction variable to include a numerical moderator in a regression model. As before, the interaction variable is the product of the predictor and the moderator. Multiply the predictor by the moderator to obtain the interaction variable.

Although we have an endless number of different moderator values or "groups", we only need one interaction variable. It represents the gradual (linear) change of the effect of the predictor for higher values of the moderator.

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\small
\begin{split}
  attitude = &\ constant + b_1*exposure + b_2*contact + b_3*exposure*contact \\
  attitude = &\ constant + (b_1 + b_3*contact)*exposure + b_2*contact 
\end{split}
(\#eq:simplecontact) 
\normalsize
\end{equation}
```
To see this, it is helpful to inspect the regression equation with rearranged terms [Equation \@ref(eq:simplecontact)]. Every additional contact with smokers adds $b_3$ to the slope $(b_1 + b_3*contact)$ of the exposure effect. The addition is gradual---a little bit of additional contact with smokers changes the exposure effect a little bit---and it is linear: A unit increase in contact adds the same amount to the effect whether the effect is at a low or a high level.

We can interpret the regression coefficient of the interaction effect ($b_3$) here as the predicted change in the exposure effect (slope) for a one unit difference in contact (the moderator). A positive coefficient indicates that the exposure effect is more positive (or less negative) for higher levels of contact with smokers. A negative coefficient indicates that the effect is more negative (or less positive) for people with more contacts with smokers.

Note that positive and negative are used here in their mathematical meaning, not in an appreciative way. A positive effect of exposure implies a more positive attitude towards smoking. Anti-smoking campaigners probably evaluate this as a negative result.

### Conditional effect {#conditional-effect-cont}

In the presence of an interaction effect of exposure and contact, the regression coefficients for exposure and contact represent conditional effects (see Section \@ref(conditional-effects)), namely, the effects for cases that score zero on the other variable. Plug in zero for the moderator and you will see that all terms with a moderator drop from the equation and only $b_1$ is left as the effect of exposure.

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\small
\begin{split}
  attitude = &\ constant + (b_1 + b_3*contact)*exposure + b_2*contact \\
  attitude = &\ constant + (b_1 + b_3*0)*exposure + b_2*0 \\
  attitude = &\ constant + b_1*exposure
\end{split}
(\#eq:conditionaleffect) 
\normalsize
\end{equation}
```
The zero score on the moderator is the *reference value* for the conditional effect of the predictor. Cases that score zero on the moderator are the *reference group* just like cases scoring zero on all dummy variables are the reference group in a model with a categorical moderator (Section \@ref(dichpredictor)).

### Mean-centering

Because the effect of a predictor involved in an interaction is a conditional effect, a zero score on the moderator has a special role. It is the reference value for the effect of the predictor. For example, the effect of exposure on attitude applies to respondents with zero contacts with smokers if the regression model includes an exposure by contact interaction. If zero on the moderator is so important as a reference value, we may want to manipulate this value to ensure that it is meaningful.

```{r mean-centering-moderator, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.pos='H', fig.align='center', fig.cap="What happens if you mean-center the moderator variable?", out.width="775px", screenshot.opts = list(delay = 5), dev="png"}

# Display a scatterplot with a line representing the conditional regression line for exposure at moderator (contact) value = 0. Shade dots in scatterplot in accordance with distance of their moderator score to the moderator reference value. 
# Display the current reference value of the moderator: "Line for contact = 0"
# Add a slider 'Contact - x' (equal length as x axis, range [0, 10], initial value 0), labeled with values 0, M - SD, M, M + SD, and 10 (use nice round numbers for SD and M, not exactly the true values). Adjusting the slider updates the regression line in the scatterplot and the reference value label.

```

What if there are no people with zero contact? Then, the interpretation of the regression coefficient $b_1$ for exposure does not make sense. In this situation, it is better to mean-center the moderator (contact) before you add it to the regression equation and before you calculate the interaction variable.

To *mean-center* a variable, you subtract the variable's mean from all scores on the variable. As a result, a mean score on the original variable becomes a zero score on the mean-centered variable.

```{=tex}
\begin{equation*}
\small
  contactcentered = contact - mean(contact)
\normalsize
\end{equation*}
```
Mean-centering shifts the values of a variable such that the mean of the new variable becomes zero (Figure \@ref(fig:mean-centering-plot)). Below-average values on the original variable are negative on a mean-centered variable and above-average values are positive. The shape of the distribution remains the same.

```{r mean-centering-plot, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.pos='H', out.width="640px", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Histograms of the original contacts with smokers variable and the mean-centered variable. The red lines represent the means."}
#create dataframe
set.seed(4932)
df <- tibble(`Contacts Original` = runif(600) * 10) %>%
  mutate(`Contacts Mean-Centered` = `Contacts Original` - mean(`Contacts Original`)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = `Contacts Original`:`Contacts Mean-Centered`, names_to = "exposure") %>%
  mutate(exposure = factor(exposure, levels = c("Contacts Original", "Contacts Mean-Centered")))
#create plots
ggplot(df) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = value), binwidth = 0.5, fill=brewercolors[["Blue"]]) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = ifelse(df$exposure == "Contacts Original", c(0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10), c(-5, -2.5, 0, 2.5, 5))) +
  facet_wrap(~exposure, nrow = 2, scales = "free_x") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = ifelse(exposure == "Contacts Original", 5, 0)), color = brewercolors[["Red"]], size = 1.5) +
  theme_bw()
```

With mean-centered numerical moderators, a conditional effect in the presence of interaction always makes sense. It is the effect of the predictor for respondents who have an average score on the moderator because they score zero on the mean-centered variable. An average score always falls within the range of scores that actually occur. If we mean-center the moderator variable contact with smokers, the regression coefficient $b_1$ for exposure expresses the effect of exposure on attitude for people with average contacts with smokers. This makes sense.

Remember that the interaction variable is the product of the predictor and moderator (Section \@ref(interaction-variable)). If any or both of these are mean-centered, you should multiply the mean-centered variable(s) to create the interaction variable.

### Symmetry of predictor and moderator

```{r symmetry-predictor-moderator, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.pos='H', fig.align='center', fig.cap=""}
# Goal: Understand the advantages of mean-centering the predictor by seeing how
# the reference value changes with mean-centering (and centering on another
# value, e.g., M plus/minus 1 SD).
# Use same data set as in app continuous-moderator: predictor = exposure,
# moderator = contact.
# Display scatterplot (x axis not labelled) with conditional regression effect
# for predictor (blue) at moderator value = 0 and conditional effect of
# moderator (red) for predictor = 0.
# Show two additional x axes marking the reference values of the predictor
# (blue) and moderator (red) (range [0, 10], initial value 0).
# Add sliders 'Exposure - x' and 'Contact - x' (equal length as two x axes,
# range [0, 10], initial value 0), labeled with values M - SD, M, and M + SD.
# Adjusting the sliders update the scale of the appropriate x axis (the marked
# point zero moves) and the regression lines in the scatterplot.

1. If you change the value on the slider 'Exposure - x', which regression line in the plot changes? Why this line?

2. Which variable is the predictor and which is the moderator if you adjust the value of the slider 'Exposure - x'?
```

If we want to interpret the conditional effect of contact on attitude ($b_2$), we must realize that this is the effect for people who score zero on the exposure variable if the exposure by contact interaction is included in the regression model. This is clear if we rearrange the regression equation as in Equation \@ref(eq:contactbyexposure).

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\small
\begin{split}
  attitude = &\ constant + b_1*exposure + b_2*contact + b_3*exposure*contact \\
  attitude = &\ constant + b_1*exposure + (b_2 + b_3*exposure)*contact \\
  attitude = &\ constant + b_1*0 + (b_2 + b_3*0)*contact \\
  attitude = &\ constant + b_2*contact 
  \end{split}
(\#eq:contactbyexposure) 
\normalsize
\end{equation}
```
But wait a minute, this is what we would do if contact was the predictor and exposure the moderator. That is a completely different situation, is it not? No, technically it does not make a difference which variable is the predictor and which is the moderator (Figure \@ref(fig:moderator-symmetry)). The predictor and moderator are symmetric. The difference is only in our theoretical expectations and in our interpretation.

```{r moderator-symmetry, echo=FALSE, fig.pos='H', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Two conceptual diagrams of moderation for the same interaction effect.", fig.asp=0.2}
# Create coordinates for the variable names.
variables <- data.frame(x = c(0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8), 
                        y = c(.1, .3, .1, .1, .3, .1),
                        hjust = c(1, 0.5, 0, 1, 0.5, 0),
                        label = c("Exposure", "Contact", "Attitude", "Contact", "Exposure", "Attitude"))
ggplot(variables, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = x[1], y = y[1], xend = x[3], yend = y[1]), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.06, "npc"), type = "closed")) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = x[2], y = y[2], xend = x[2], yend = y[1]), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.06, "npc"), type = "closed")) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = x[4], y = y[4], xend = x[6], yend = y[4]), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.06, "npc"), type = "closed")) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = x[5], y = y[5], xend = x[5], yend = y[4]), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.06, "npc"), type = "closed")) +
  geom_label(aes(label=label, hjust = hjust)) + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0.15, 0.85), ylim = c(0, 0.4)) +
  theme_void()
# Cleanup.
rm(variables)
```

For example, let us assume that the regression coefficient of the interaction effect of exposure and contact is 0.2. We can interpret this regression coefficient with contact as moderator and exposure as predictor: An additional unit of contact with smokers increases the effect of exposure on attitude by 0.2. But we can also interpret it with exposure as moderator and contact as predictor: An additional unit of exposure increases the effect of contact with smokers on attitude by 0.2.

The conditional effect of the moderator, as stated above, is the effect of the moderator if the predictor is zero. This interpretation makes sense only if there are cases with zero scores on the predictor. In the current example, the scores on exposure range from 0 to 10, so zero exposure is meaningful. But it represents a borderline score with perhaps a very atypical effect of contact on attitude or few observations. For these reasons, it is recommended to *mean-center both the predictor and moderator if they are numerical*. In case of a dichotomous or categorical moderator (Section \@ref(categoricalmoderator)), the predictor can also be mean-centered.

### Visualization of the interaction effect

It can be quite tricky to interpret regression coefficients in a regression model that contains interaction effects. The safest strategy is to draw regression lines for different values of the moderator. But what are interesting values if the moderator is numerical?

```{r continuous-interaction-visualization, fig.pos='H', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Which moderator values are helpful for visualizing moderation?", echo=FALSE, screenshot.opts = list(delay = 5), dev="png", out.width="775px"}

# + 2SD. Display the selected lines in different colours.

```{block2, type='rmdquestion'}
9. Select one or more options in Figure \@ref(fig:continuous-interaction-visualization) to represent regression lines predicting attitude from exposure at different values of the moderator (contact with smokers). Respondents with moderator values close to the selected value are coloured. Which moderator values would you pick to communicate the results of moderation? Motivate your answer. [<img src="icons/2answer.png" width=115px align="right">](#answer9.1.9)
```

As we have seen in Section \@ref(interpret-cont-interaction), the regression coefficient of an interaction effect with a numerical moderator can be directly interpreted. It represents the predicted difference in the unstandardized effect size for a one unit increase in the moderator. For example, one more contact with a smoker increases the exposure effect by 0.04.

The size of the interaction effect tells us the moderation trend, for instance, people who are more around smokers tend to be less opposed to smoking if they are exposed to the anti-smoking campaign. But we do not know how much an anti-smoking attitude is fostered by exposure to a campaign and whether exposure to the campaign increases anti-smoking attitude for everyone. Perhaps, people hanging out with smokers a lot may even get a more positive attitude towards smoking from campaign exposure.

We can be more specific about exposure effects at different levels of contact with smokers if we pick some interesting values of the moderator and calculate the conditional effects at these levels.

The minimum or maximum values of the moderator are usually not very interesting. We tend to have few observations for these values, so our confidence in the estimated effect at that level is low. Instead, the values one standard deviation below and above the mean of the moderator are popular values to be picked. One standard deviation below the mean (M - SD) indicates a low value, the mean (M) indicates a central value, and one standard deviation above the mean (M + SD) indicates a high value.

Having picked these values, we can visualize moderation as different regression lines in a plot. We use exactly the same approach as in visualizing moderation by a categorical variable. As a first step, we construct equations for conditional effects of the predictor at different levels of the moderator. Plug the selected value of the moderator into the regression equation. If there are covariates, also plug in a meaningful value for the covariates, usually the average for numerical covariates and zero or one for dichotomous covariates. As a second step, we use the equations to add regression lines to a scatter plot.

If contact (the moderator) is mean-centered, as in the current example, we simply plug in zero for the moderator to obtain the equation for the regression line at the mean of the moderator (contact with smokers). We also have to plug in a value for each covariate. This example contains one covariate, namely smoking status (variable *smoker*). We plug in the score for non-smokers (0). In the end, our predictor (exposure) should be the only variable in the right hand side of the regression equation [the last line in Equation \@ref(eq:regsimpleslopemoderated)].

\end{split}
(\#eq:regsimpleslopemoderated) 
\normalsize
\end{equation}
```

We plug in the value of the standard deviation of contact with smokers to get the regression equation for people who scored one standard deviation above the mean on the mean-centered moderator. The standard deviation of contact is 2.0 in this example, so Equation \@ref(eq:regsimpleslopemoderated2) replaces contact by 2.0 everywhere.

We plug in minus the value of one standard deviation if we want the regression line for the moderator at the mean minus one standard deviation. Do this yourself, as an exercise. Now, we can draw the regression lines in a scatterplot as we have learned in the preceding chapter (Instruction video \@ref(fig:SPSSregmodlines)).

Instead of writing out the full equations, add columns (Table \@ref(tab:cont-moderator-results)) to the regression coefficients table for each simple regression line that you want to draw:

1.  Add a column indicating which value you plug in for the moderator variable(s) and any covariates. In this example, *contact* is the moderator variable, which appears both by itself and as part of the interaction variable. The variable *smoker* is a covariate here; we select the non-smokers (coded 0).

2.  Add a column to calculate the constant. Use all variables that do *not* include the predictor. For each of these variables, multiply the regression coefficient by the plug-in value (if any). Sum the results to obtain the constant.

3.  Add a column to calculate the simple slope. Only use the variables that include the predictor, which is *exposure* in this example. For each of these variables, multiply the regression coefficient by the plug-in value (if any). Sum the results to obtain the simple slope.

```

The footnotes to Table \@ref(tab:cont-moderator-results) show the resulting simple regression equations. You can interpret the slopes, which are unstandardized regression coefficients ($b$), or use the equations to draw regression lines.

If the moderator is not mean-centered, we have to plug in the value of the mean of the moderator and the value of the mean plus or minus the standard deviation of the moderator. Let us assume that the mean score of contact with smokers is 5.1 in this example. The moderator mean minus one standard deviation (2.0) equals 3.1 and the mean plus one standard deviation is 7.1.

The regression model yields a *p* value and confidence interval for the predictor at the reference value of the moderator. In the model estimated in Table \@ref(tab:cont-moderator-output), for instance, we obtain a *p* value of `r report_n(results[2,5], 3)` and a 95% confidence interval of [`r report_n(results[2,6],2)`, `r report_n(results[2,7],2)`] for the effect of exposure on attitude. This is the conditional effect of exposure on attitude for cases that score zero on the moderator variable (contact with smokers).

If the moderator variable *contact* is mean-centered, the *p* value tests the null hypothesis that the effect of exposure is zero for people who have average contact with smokers. The confidence interval tells us that the effect of exposure on attitude for people with average contacts with smokers in the population ranges between `r report_n(results[2,6],2)` and `r report_n(results[2,7],2)` with 95% confidence. If the moderator is not mean-centered, the results apply to people who have no contact with smokers.

Note that mean-centering of the moderator changes, so to speak, the regression line that we test. Instead of testing the effect of exposure for people with no smoker contact, we test the effect for people with average contact with smokers if the moderator is mean-centered. If we would like to get the *p* value or confidence interval for the regression line at one standard deviation above (or below) the mean, we have to center the moderator at that value before we estimate the regression model. In this course, however, we will not do so.

```{r echo=FALSE}
#Cleanup.
rm(results, report_n)
```

### Common support

In Section \@ref(commonsupportdichotomous), we checked the support of the predictor in the data for different groups of the moderator. The basic idea is that we can only sensibly estimate and interpret a conditional effect at a moderator level if we have observations over the entire range of the predictor. For each moderator group, we checked the distribution of the predictor.

With a numerical moderator we can also do this if we group moderator scores. Hainmueller et al. [-@RefWorks:3838] recommend creating three groups, each containing one third of all observations. These low, medium, and high groups correspond more or less with the minus one standard deviation/mean/plus one standard deviation values that we used for visualizing and testing conditional effects. Create a histogram for the predictor in each of these groups to check common support of moderation in the data, as explained in micro lecture \@ref(fig:SPSSregSupport1).

```{r cont-moderator-support, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.pos='H', fig.align='center', out.width="640px", fig.cap="Common support of the predictor variable (exposure) at three levels of the moderator variable (contact)."}
# Display predictor (exposure) values for three groups of the moderator (contact).
smokers %>% #data read in previous code chunk
  mutate(contact_bin = factor(ntile(contact, 3),
                              levels = c(1, 2, 3),
                              labels = c("Low contact", "Medium contact", "High contact"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = exposure)) +
    geom_histogram(fill = brewercolors[5], binwidth = 1) +
    facet_wrap(~contact_bin, ncol = 1) +
    scale_x_continuous(name = "Exposure", breaks = 0:10) +
    theme_general()

# Cleanup.
rm(smokers)
```

According to Figure \@ref(fig:cont-moderator-support), the predictor variable exposure covers the entire range from 0 to 10 at medium and high contact levels. At low contact level, however, the lowest exposure score is 1 instead of zero. In all, we have common support for moderation of the exposure effect by contact for exposure scores from 1 to 10. This is quite a broad range but we should note that we have few observations of low exposure at the low contact level as well as few observations of high exposure at the high contact level.

### Assumptions

The general assumptions for regression analysis (Section \@ref(regr-inference)) also apply to a regression model with a moderator (interaction effect). The checks are the same: See if the residuals are more or less normally distributed and check the residuals by predicted values plot.

Note that the linearity assumption also applies to the interaction effect. If the interaction effect is positive, the exposure (predictor) effect must be higher for higher values of contact with smokers (moderator). More precisely, a unit difference on the moderator should result in a fixed increase (or decrease) of the effect of the predictor. You may have noticed this linear change in the effect size in Figure \@ref(fig:continuous-moderator) at the beginning of this section on numerical moderators.

It is difficult to check this assumption, so let us not pursue this here. Just remember that the interaction effect is assumed to be linear: a gradually increasing or decreasing effect of the predictor at higher moderator values.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
### Comparing nested regression models

Discuss F Change test here with distinction between 'main' effects in model without interaction predictor and conditional effects in (nested?) model with interaction predictor ; additional SPSS clip?
Cf. Fam: Discuss a two-step approach to moderation? In the first model estimate effects without the interaction predictor, so we have the average or main effects (as in ANOVA). In the second model, add the interaction predictor. Now, the former main effect is the effect for the reference group or value (zero) on the moderator.
Pros/cons: Adds F Change test; F Change test does not add to significance test of interaction predictor?; highlights interpretation difference of seemingly the same effect (main effect becomes conditional effect); main effects are interesting only if there is no interaction effect?
```

### Higher-order interaction effects

An interaction effect with one moderator, whether numerical or categorical, is called *first-order interaction* or *two-way interaction*. It is possible to have a moderated effect that is moderated itself by a second moderator. For example, the change in the exposure effect due to a person's contact with smokers may be different for smokers than for non-smokers. This is called a *second-order interaction* or *three-way interaction*. We can include more moderators, yielding even higher-order interactions, such as three or four moderators.

An interaction variable that is the product of the predictor and two moderators can be used to include a second-order interaction in a regression model. If you include a second-order interaction, you must also include the effects of the variables involved in the interaction as well as all first-order interactions among these variables in the regression model. All in all, these models become very complicated to interpret and they are beyond the scope of the current course.

```{block2, type='rmdanswer'}
Answer to Question 1. 

* In principle, there is an unlimited number of conditional effects if the moderator is a continuous variable.
* In the app, however, the slider allows you to increase or decrease contact score by 0.1. In the app, there are effectively 101 (0 to 10 in steps of 0.1) moderator values that you can select, so there are 101 different regression lines that can be depicted.

```

<A name="answer9.1.2"></A>

```{block2, type='rmdanswer'}
Answer to Question 2. 

* Move the slider from left to right to find the moderator value at which the
regression line is horizontal. This happens if contact is 6.5. For higher values of contact as moderator, the slope of the regression line is positive. Here, more exposure leads to a more positive attitude.
* Or have a close look at the equations. The regression coefficient of the (simple) slope of the exposure effect is zero if (_b_~1~ + _b_~3~ * contact) is zero. We know _b_~1~ and _b_~3~, so we can solve the equation:

> -0.26 + 0.04 * contact = 0

Your high-school algebra may help you:

> 0.04 * contact = 0.26

> contact = 0.26 / 0.04 = 6.5 [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.1.2)
```

<A name="answer9.1.3"></A>

```{block2, type='rmdanswer'}
Answer to Question 3. 

* Each increment of 1 unit of contact increases the (simple) slope of the
exposure effect on attitude by 0.04, that is, by the value of the interaction
effect.
* This is easy to see in the equation for the effect of exposure:

> -0.26 + 0.04 * contact

* Plug in 0 for contact: The simple slope is -0.26.
* Plug in 1 for contact: The simple slope is -0.26 + 0.04 * 1.
* The difference is 0.04. This difference is the same for every increase of
one unit in contact, so it is also the difference between the slopes at
contact levels six and seven. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.1.3)

Answer to Question 4. 

* In the initial situation, the regression line in this figure represents the
predictive effect of exposure on attitude for respondents who score zero on the
moderator (contact with smokers).
* In this regression model, the regression coefficient of exposure is -0.26,
so an additional unit of exposure decreases the predicted attitude by 0.26 for
respondents who have no (zero) contacts with smokers. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.1.4)
```

<A name="answer9.1.5"></A>

```{block2, type='rmdanswer'}
Answer to Question 5. 

* We can spot some light-blue dots in the graph but no dark blue dots. There is no sizable set of participants with (hardly) any contact with smokers. There are (hardly) any participants to whom the effect expressed by -.26 applies.
* In other words, this regression coefficient is hardly supported by data, so it is quite meaningless. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.1.5)
```

<A name="answer9.1.6"></A>

```{block2, type='rmdanswer'}
Answer to Question 6. 

* Plug in zero for the mean-centered contact variable: 

> Attitude = 1.10 + -0.06 * Exposure + 0.14 * Contact_c + 0.04 * Exposure * Contact_c

> Attitude = 1.10 + -0.06 * Exposure + 0.14 * 0 + 0.04 * Exposure * 0

* And simplify: 

> Attitude = 1.10 + -0.06 * Exposure + 0 + 0

> Attitude = 1.10 + -0.06 * Exposure

Note that the effect of exposure on attitude is less strongly negative (-0.06) if mean-centered contact is zero than for the original contact variable at zero (-0.26, see the blue equation). [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.1.6)
```

<A name="answer9.1.7"></A>

```{block2, type='rmdanswer'}
Answer to Question 7. 

* The regression line for the mean-centered contact moderator coincides with the blue regression line if we select 5 as value for the original contact variable. 
* Apparently, the reference group (scoring zero) on the mean-centered contact variable consists of respondents who score 5 on the original _Contact with smokers_ variable.
* By mean centering, we assign the score zero to respondents who have a mean score on the original variable. Apparently, the mean of the original contact variable is 5. 
* Now that they score zero on the new mean-centered variable, they have become the reference group. The regression coefficient of the simple regression equation with mean-centered contact as moderator (see Question 6) is the effect for people with average contacts with smokers: An additional unit of exposure predicts a decrease of 0.06 in the attitude towards smokers for people who have average contact with smokers.

```

<A name="answer9.1.8"></A>

```{block2, type='rmdanswer'}
Answer to Question 8. 

* Now there are many (dark) blue dots, so there is a sizable number of participants who have around average contact with smokers. The regression coefficient for the effect of exposure applies to quite some participants in the sample, so it is meaningful.
* The mean of a variable is usually a value with a lot of observations nearby. This makes it a good reference value in a moderation model. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.1.8)
```

<A name="answer9.1.9"></A>

```{block2, type='rmdanswer'}
Answer to Question 9. 

* The important thing is to understand that a regression line that depends on
few observations is not very trustworthy. The line usually does not represent
the observations well. In addition, these few observations may have different
predictor and dependent variable values in a new sample, so the regression line may be
quite different at this moderator value in a new sample.
* The minimum and maximum value observed in the current sample represent
regression lines that are quite outside the dot cloud. They are based on very
few observations, so they are not very trustworthy.
* Observations with moderator values at two standard deviations away from the
mean (options: M - 2SD and M + 2SD) are still quite rare.
* Observations with moderator values at one standard deviations away from the
mean (options: M - 1SD and M + 1SD) are quite common. These regression
lines are nicely embedded in the dot cloud. They are good candidates for
interpreting moderation.
* Of course, moderator values even closer to the mean, such as moderator values
below or above which we find one third of all scores (the first and third
terciles) are also well supported by observations, as is the moderator mean
itself. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.1.9)

If we report a regression model, we first present the significance test and predictive power of the entire regression model. We may report that the regression model is statistically significant, *F* (`r resultsF[[1,4]]`, `r resultsF[[2,4]]`) = `r report_n(as.numeric(resultsF[[1,6]]),2)`, *p* `r ifelse(resultsF[[1,7]] == "0.000", "< 0.001", paste0("=", resultsF[[1,7]]))`, so the regression model very likely helps to predict attitude towards smoking in the population.

How well does the regression model predict attitude towards smoking? The effect size of a regression model or its predictive power is summarized by $R^2$ (*R Square*), which is the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable scores (attitude towards smoking) that can be predicted with the regression model. In this example, $R^2$ is `r report_n(summ$r.squared, 2)`, so the regression model predicts `r report_n(summ$r.squared * 100, 0)`% of the variance in attitude towards smoking among the respondents. In communication research, $R^2$ is usually smaller.

$R^2$ tells us how well the regression model predicts the dependent variable in the sample. Every predictor that we add to the regression model helps to predict results in the sample even if the predictor does not help to predict the dependent variable in the population. For a better idea of the predictive power of the regression model in the population, we may use *Adjusted R Square*. Adjusted R Square is usually slightly lower than R Square. In the example, Adjusted R Square is `r report_n(summ$adj.r.squared, 2)` (not reported in Table \@ref(tab:report-moderation-table)).

```{r report-moderation-table, echo=FALSE}
# Table.
options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
knitr::kable(table, booktabs = TRUE, align = c("l", "c"),
             caption = "Predicting attitude towards smoking with smoking status and contact with smokers as moderators. Results in APA style. Exposure and contact are mean-centered.") %>%
  footnote(general = "_N_ = 150. CI = confidence interval.",
           symbol =  "*\\* _p_ < .05. \\*\\* _p_ < .01. \\*** _p_ < .001.",
           general_title = "Note.", title_format = c("italic"),
           symbol_title = "",
           footnote_as_chunk = T) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 12, full_width = F, position = "float_right",
                latex_options = c("HOLD_position"))
```

As a next step, we discuss the size, statistical significance, and confidence intervals of the regression coefficients. If a predictor is involved in one or more interaction effects, we must be very clear about the reference value or reference group to which the effect applies. In the example below, non-smokers are the reference group on the smoking status variable because they are not represented by a dummy variable. Average number of contacts with smokers is the reference value on the contact variable because this variable is mean-centered.

Exposure, in our example, has a negative predictive effect on attitude towards smoking (*b* = `r report_n(results[2,1])`) for non-smokers with average contacts with smokers, *t* = `r report_n(results[2,3])`, `r ifelse(results[2,4] < .0005, "p < .001", paste0("p = ", report_n(results[2,4], digits=3)))`, 95% CI [`r report_n(ci[2,1])`, `r report_n(ci[2,2])`]. Note that SPSS does not report the degrees of freedom for the *t* test on a regression coefficient, so we cannot report them.

Instead of presenting the numerical results in the text, we may summarize them in an APA style table, such as Table \@ref(tab:report-moderation-table). Note that *t* and *p* values are not reported in this table, the focus is on the confidence intervals. The significance level is indicated by stars.

A sizable and statistically significant interaction effect signals that an effect is moderated. In the example reported in Table \@ref(tab:report-moderation-table), the effect of exposure on attitude seems to be moderated by contact with smokers (*b* = `r report_n(results[6,1])`, `r ifelse(results[6,4] < .0005, "p < .001", paste0("p = ", report_n(results[6,4], digits=3)))`) and by smoking status (*b* = `r report_n(results[7,1])`, `r ifelse(results[7,4] < .0005, "p < 0.001", paste0("p = ", report_n(results[7,4], digits=3)))` for former smoker).

The regression coefficients for interaction effects must be interpreted as effect differences. For a categorical moderator, the coefficient describes the effect size difference between the category represented by the dummy variable and the reference group. The negative effect of exposure is stronger for former smokers than for the reference group non-smokers. The average difference is `r report_n(results[7,1])`.

For a numerical moderator, we can interpret the general pattern reflected by the interaction effect. A positive interaction effect, such as `r report_n(results[6, 1])` for the interaction between exposure and smoker contact, signals that the effect of exposure is more strongly positive or less strongly negative at higher levels of contact with smokers.

This interpretation in terms of effect differences remains difficult to understand. It is recommended to select some interesting values for the moderator and report the size of the effect for each value. For a categorical moderator, each category is of interest. For a numerical moderator, the mean and one standard deviation below and above the mean are usually interesting values. The regression coefficients show whether the effect is positive, negative, or nearly zero at different values of the moderator.

Visualize the regression lines for different values of the moderator in addition to presenting the numerical results. If the regression model contains covariates, mention the values that you have used for the covariates. Select one of the categories for a categorical covariate. For numerical covariates, the mean is a good choice. If you are working with mean-centered predictors, be sure to use the mean-centered predictor for the horizontal axis (as in Figure \@ref(fig:report-moderator-visual)), not the original predictor.

# It is possible to translate the regression equation for a mean-centered predictor back to the original scale of the predictor. The simple slope (of the conditional effects) remains the same. The intercept has to be adjusted: It is the intercept estimated for the mean-centered predictor minus the mean of the original predictor times the slope. Graphically speaking, the intercept must be moved from the mean of the original predictor, which is zero on the mean-centered predictor) to zero on the original predictor, which is minus the original mean on the mean-centered predictor. The inercept with the original predictor, then, is M steps to the left from zero on the regressio line for the mean-centered predictor.

The left panel in Figure \@ref(fig:report-moderator-visual) clearly shows that the effect of exposure on attitude is more or less the same for non-smokers and smokers. The effect is different for former smokers, for whom the exposure effect is more strongly negative. It is more difficult to communicate this conclusion with the table of regression coefficients.

Check that the predictor has good support at the selected values of the moderator. In the left-hand plot of Figure \@ref(fig:report-moderator-visual), the groups (colours) vary nicely over the entire range of the predictor *exposure*, so that is okay. We need histograms to check common support for the right-hand plot.

Do not report that common support of the predictor at different moderator values is good. If it is bad, warn the reader that we cannot fully trust the estimated moderation because we do not have a nice range of predictor values within each level of the moderator. If the predictor is supported only within a restricted range, you may report this range.

Finally, inspect the residual plots but do not include them in the report. Warn the reader if the assumptions of the linear regression model have not been met. Do not mention the assumptions if they have been met.

  * The regression model predicts 38 per cent of the variation in the dependent
variable, *F* (4, 307) = 47.76, *p* < .001.
* The effects of exposure and contact with smokers must be interpreted with care due to their interaction effect. These are conditional effects.
* The estimated effect of exposure applies to adults who score zero on the variable contact with smokers. In this context, exposure to the campaign makes the predicted attitude towards smoking more negative (a 0.37 to 0.70 attitude decrease for an additional unit of exposure), *b* = -0.54, *t* = -6.50, *p* < .001, 95% CI [-0.70, -0.37].
* Contact with smokers may make the attitude more positive but also more negative for adults who are not exposed to the anti-smoking campaign, *b* = 0.02, *t* = 0.17, *p* = .864, 95% CI [-0.16, 0.19].
* The interaction effect is positive and statistically significantly different from zero, *b* = .04, *t* = 2.80, *p* = .005, 95% CI [0.01, 0.08]. For adults who have more contacts with smokers, the efect of exposure on attitude is less strongly negative. In other words, exposure seems to be less effective in making the attitude towards smoking more negative if adults have more contacts with smokers.
* The effect of smoking status is not statistically significantly different from zero, *b* = 0.26, *t* = 1.28, *p* = .201, 95% CI [-0.14, 0.66]. This variable is used as a covariate, so it does not have our interest. Therefore, effects of covariates are usually not interpreted.

Answer to Exercise 2. 

SPSS syntax:  
  
\* Create scatterplot.  
GRAPH  
  /SCATTERPLOT(BIVAR)=exposure WITH attitude  
  /MISSING=LISTWISE.  
  
Manually add three regression lines:  
  
* Write out the regression equations for different values of the moderator.
* Plug in the estimated values of the regression coefficients, the means of
covariates, and three values for the moderator using its M and SD.
  
The initial equation for non-smokers (status = 0):  
  
attitude = 1.442 + -0.536\*exposure + 0.015\*contact + 
  0.044\*exposure\*contact + 0.259\*status  
  
attitude = 1.442 + -0.536\*exposure + 0.015\*contact + 
  0.044\*exposure\*contact + 0.259\*0  
  
attitude = 1.442 + (-0.536 + 0.044\*contact)\*exposure + 0.015\*contact  
  
The equation with Contact = M - SD  
  
attitude = 1.442 + (-0.536 + 0.044\*(4.995 - 1.939))\*exposure + 0.015\*(4.995 - 1.939)  
  
attitude = 1.442 + (-0.536 + 0.044\*3.056)\*exposure + 0.015\*3.056  
  
attitude = 1.442 + (-0.536 + 0.134)\*exposure + .046  
  
attitude = 1.488 + -.402\*exposure  
  
The equation with Contact = M  
  
attitude = 1.442 + (-0.536 + 0.044\*4.995)\*exposure + 0.015\*4.995  
  
attitude = 1.442 + (-0.536 + 0.220)\*exposure + .075  
  
attitude = 1.517 + -0.316\*exposure  
  
The equation with Contact = M + SD  
  
attitude = 1.442 + (-0.536 + 0.044\*(4.995 + 1.939))\*exposure + 0.015\*(4.995 + 1.939)  
  
attitude = 1.442 + (-0.536 + 0.044\*6.934)\*exposure + 0.015\*6.934  
  
attitude = 1.442 + (-0.536 + .305)\*exposure + 0.104  
  
attitude = 1.546 + -0.231\*exposure  

![](figures/S9_3Q2.png)
  
Interpret the results:  
    
* The negative predictive effect of exposure on attitude towards smoking is
slightly stronger (more negative) for adults with relatively few contacts with smokers (who score one standard deviation below average contact with smokers). The effect is less negative for adults with relatively many contacts with smokers (one standard deviation above average contact).

Check data: See Exercise 1.  
  
Check assumptions: See Exercise 1.  
  
Interpret the results:  
  
* The size and significance of the interaction effect have not changed at all. Mean-centering only changes the reference values for the effects of the predictor and the moderator. It does not affect the interaction effect.
* The coefficient for exposure now expresses the predictive effect of exposure for adults with average contact with smokers. They have more contact with smokers than the reference group in Exercise 1, who had no contact with smokers. The interaction effect tells us that the effect of exposure becomes less negative at higher levels of contact. This explains that we have a higher (less strongly negative) value for the exposure coefficient now. It still is negative, so more exposure to the anti-smoking campaign predicts a more negative attitude towards smoking for adults with average contact with smokers, *b* = -0.32, *t* = -9.77, *p* < .001, 95% CI [-0.38, -0.25].
* The positive effect of contact with smokers on attitude is stronger now (*b* = 0.23) than in Exercise 1 (*b* = 0.02). The interaction effect tells us that contact has a more positive effect on smoking attitude for higher levels of campaign exposure. As a result, the effect of contact at average exposure is stronger than at zero exposure.
* Why do we have a statistical significant result for the effect of contact
now (*p* < .001) but not in Exercise 1 (*p* = .864)?
* Part of the answer is that the unstandardized effect is larger (*b* = 0.23) now than in Exercise 1 (*b* = 0.02). It is further away from zero so it is easier to reject the nil hypothesis. The standard error is the other part of the answer. The standard error is smaller now: *SE* = 0.05 against *SE* = 0.09 in Exercise 1. We have quite some observations with about average contact score (the reference value if we mean-center) but hardly any observations with minimum (zero) contact score. With fewer observations, we are less certain about estimates, so we have a larger standard error, and it is more difficult to be confident that the regression coefficient is not zero in the population.

* The residuals are quite normally distributed, as they should.  
* The residuals are centered around zero for all levels of the predicted
scores (linearity) but the variation in residuals seems to be a bit smaller at higher predicted values (the residuals may not be homoscedastic).
  
Interpret the results:  
    
* The regression model predicts 27 per cent of the differences in media literacy among children, *F* (4, 461) = 43.07, *p* < .001.
* There is no remarkable difference between girls and boys, *t* = -0.96, *p* = .338, 95% CI [-0.40, 0.14]. Girls may be upto 0.14 more media literate on average than boys but they can also score on average 0.40 below the average score of boys on media literacy.
* Age has a statistically significant positive effect on media literacy for children at average parental supervision, *t* = 7.80, *p* < .001, 95% CI [0.21, 0.36].
* Parental supervision has a positive effect on media literacy for children at average age, *t* = 9.14, *p* < .001, 95% CI [0.32, 0.49].  
* There is no statistically significant interaction effect between age and parental supervision on media literacy, *t* = -0.07, *p* =.943, 95% CI [-0.05, 0.05]. If there is an interaction effect in the population, it can be negative as well as positive.

* Write out the regression equations for different values of the moderator.
* Plug in the estimated values of the regression coefficients, the selected category of the covariate, and three values for the moderator using its *M* and *SD*.
* Create regression lines for the effect of media literacy at three levels of parental supervision (*M - SD*, *M*, and *M + SD*) in the scatterplot of media literacy by mean-centered parental supervision.
  
Estimated regression equation:   
    
medliter = 7.321 + -0.130 \* girl + 0.284 \* age_centered + 0.406 \* supervision_centered + 
  -0.002 \* age_centered \* supervision_c

medliter = 7.321 + 0.284 \* age_centered + 
  (0.406  + -0.002 \* age_centered) \* supervision_centered  
  
Age at M - SD (mean-centered so M = 0, SD = 1.879) for boys:

medliter = 7.321 + 0.406\*supervision  
  
Age at M + SD (M = 0, SD = 1.879) for boys:

Check data: 

* There are no impossible values on the variables. Variable _gender_ has values 1 and 2, so we must create a new variable with values 0 and 1. In the syntax, this variable is called _male_ with 0 meaning 'no (female)' and 1 meaning 'yes (male)'.  
  
Check assumptions:  
  
![](figures/S9_3Q6a.png)

* The residuals are quite normally distributed and centered around zero for all levels of the predicted scores (linearity).
* The variation in residuals seems to be similar at low (-1), medium (0), and high (+1) predicted values, so the residuals seem to be homoscedastic. There are relatively few very low (-2 to -6) predicted values, so it is hard to evaluate the variation in residuals here.
  
Interpret the results:  
  
* The regression model predicts 22 per cent of the variation in the dependent variable, *F* (4, 515) = 35.96, *p* < .001.
* Males seem to have a slightly higher average intention to buy products of the brand than females (*b* = 0.17) but this difference is not statistically significant at the five per cent level, *t* = 1.39, *p* = .164, 95% CI [-0.07, 0.40]. We are 95% confident that the average difference in buying intention between males and females is not larger than .40 in the population, which is not much on the ten-point scale used to measure buying intention.
* Exposure to brand advertisements has a statistically significant positive effect on buying intention for people with average brand awareness, *b* = 0.28, *t* = 6.81, *p* < .001, 95% CI [0.20, 0.36]. More exposure coincides with higher buying intention for people with average brand awareness.
* Similarly, the effect of brand awareness on buying intention is positive (*b* = 0.12) for people with average ad exposure. This effect is statistically significant, *t* = 2.91, *p* = .004, 95% CI [0.04, 0.20]. Higher brand awareness is associated with higher intention to buy.
* The interaction effect of ad exposure and brand awareness on buying intention is negative (*b* = -0.09) and significantly different from zero, *t* = -4.44, *p* < .001, 95% CI [-0.13, -0.05]. More ad exposure reduces the positive effect of brand awareness on buying intention and more brand awareness reduces the positive effect of ad exposure on buying intention as illustrated by the below plots. We could conclude that ad exposure seems to be more efficient at increasing buying attention for people who know the brand less well (who have lower brand awareness). However, we are not sure that the effect is causal (see Chapter \@ref(confounder)).

![](figures/S9_3Q6b.png)

This is our starting point for calculating simple regression equations to be displayed in a scatterplot. We create regression lines for females (covariate value is 0) and we use the mean-centered variables:

intention = constant + 0.165 * male + 0.279 * ad_expo_c + 0.122 * brand_aw_c + -0.092 * ad_expo_c * brand_aw_c

Enter the value of the constant and of females:
  
intention = 5.896 + 0.165 * 0 + 0.279 * ad_expo_c + 0.122 * brand_aw_c + -0.092 * ad_expo_c * brand_aw_c

This reduces to:
  
intention = 5.896 + 0.279 * ad_expo_c + 0.122 * brand_aw_c + -0.092 * ad_expo_c * brand_aw_c

* To add regression lines for different levels of brand awareness to a scatterplot of buying intention by ad exposure, plug in values for brand awareness.

Effect of ad exposure at a low value of brand awareness (M - SD = 0 - 1.577 = -1.577, get the standard deviation from the regression descriptives):
  
intention = 5.896 + 0.279 * ad_expo_c + 0.122 * -1.577 + -0.092 * ad_expo_c * -1.577

Which simplifies to:
  
intention = 5.896 + 0.122 * -1.577 + 0.279 * ad_expo_c + -0.092 * -1.577 * ad_expo_c

intention = 5.896 + -0.192 + 0.279 * ad_expo_c + 0.145 * ad_expo_c

intention = 5.704 + (0.279 + 0.145) * ad_expo_c

intention = 5.704 + 0.424 * ad_expo_c

Effect of ad exposure at a medium value of brand awareness (M = 0):
  
intention = 5.896 + 0.279 * ad_expo_c + 0.122 * 0 + -0.092 * ad_expo_c * 0

Which simplifies to:
  
intention = 5.896 + 0.279 * ad_expo_c + 0 + 0

intention = 5.896 + 0.279 * ad_expo_c

Effect of ad exposure at a high value of brand awareness (M + SD = 0 + 1.577 = 1.577):
  
intention = 5.896 + 0.279 * ad_expo_c + 0.122 * 1.577 + -0.092 * ad_expo_c * 1.577

Which simplifies to:
  
intention = 5.896 + 0.122 * 1.577 + 0.279 * ad_expo_c + -0.092 * 1.577 * ad_expo_c

intention = 5.896 + 0.192 + 0.279 * ad_expo_c + -0.145 * ad_expo_c

intention = 6.088 + (0.279 - 0.145) * ad_expo_c

intention = 6.088 + 0.134 * ad_expo_c

* To add regression lines for different levels of ad exposure to a scatterplot of buying intention by brand awareness, plug in values for ad exposure.

intention = 5.896 + 0.279 * ad_expo_c + 0.122 * brand_aw_c + -0.092 * ad_expo_c * brand_aw_c

Effect of brand awareness at a low value of ad exposure (M - SD = 0 - 1.636 = -1.636, get the standard deviation from the regression descriptives):
  
intention = 5.896 + 0.279 * -1.636 + 0.122 * brand_aw_c + -0.092 * -1.636 * brand_aw_c

Which simplifies to:
  
intention = 5.896 + -0.456 + 0.122 * brand_aw_c + 0.151 * brand_aw_c

intention = (5.896 + -0.456) + (0.122 + 0.151) * brand_aw_c

intention = 5.440 + 0.273 * brand_aw_c

intention = 5.896 + 0.279 * 0 + 0.122 * brand_aw_c + -0.092 * 0 * brand_aw_c

Which simplifies to:

intention = 5.896 + 0 + 0.122 * brand_aw_c + 0

intention = 5.896 + 0.122 * brand_aw_c

Effect of brand awareness at a high value of ad exposure (M + SD = 0 + 1.636 = 1.636):
  
intention = 5.896 + 0.279 * 1.636 + 0.122 * brand_aw_c + -0.092 * 1.636 * brand_aw_c

Which simplifies to:
  
intention = 5.896 + 0.456 + 0.122 * brand_aw_c + -0.151 * brand_aw_c

intention = (5.896 + 0.456) + (0.122 + -0.151) * brand_aw_c

intention = 6.352 + -0.029 * brand_aw_c [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.3.6)

## Test Your Understanding

Figure \@ref(fig:moderator-overview) shows the relation between exposure to an anti-smoking campaign and attitude towards smoking. The effect of exposure on attitude is moderated by daily contacts with people who smoke.

Answer to Question 1. 

* The (red) regression line represents the (estimated) predictive effect of
exposure on attitude for a particular value of contact (with smokers).
* Contact is a moderator of the effect of exposure on attitude. In the initial
plot after loading the app, the value of contact is zero, so the regression
line expresses the predictive effect of exposure on attitude for respondents
who have no contact with smokers. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.4.1)
```

<A name="answer9.4.2"></A>

```{block2, type='rmdanswer', echo=ch9}
Answer to Question 2. 

* A change of the slider changes the moderator value, so the regression line
is re-estimated for respondents with another number of contacts with smokers.
As a result, the regression line is redrawn (the previous regression line is
shown in grey).
* Because the regression line represents respondents with a different
moderator score, the regression line is based on other observations (dots in
the plot). The observations with scores closest to the selected moderator
value are coloured blue. Changing the moderator value changes the relevant
observations.
* If the moderator value increases, the regression line's decrease is less
steep and at some point changes into an increase from left to right. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.4.2)
```

<A name="answer9.4.3"></A>

```{block2, type='rmdanswer', echo=ch9}
Answer to Question 3. 

* Due to the interaction effect between exposure and contact in the model, the
predictive effect of exposure depends on the respondent's contact score. For
this reason, the respondent's contact score and its interaction regression
coefficient are included in the (conditional) predictive effect of exposure.
Thus, contact adds to (or subtracts from) the predictive effect of exposure.
* The slope of the regression line becomes less negative or more positive for
higher moderator (contact) values because the interaction effect is positive
(0.04). Every additional unit on the moderator adds 0.04 to the regression
slope of the conditional effect of exposure. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.4.3)

```{block2, type='rmdanswer', echo=ch9}
Answer to Question 4. 

* The effects of exposure (*b*~1~) and contact (*b*~2~) are conditional because both variables are included in an interaction effect.
* The effect of exposure on attitude represents the effect for one particular value of the moderator variable contact.
* But moderation is symmetrical in the sense that we can also see exposure as moderator of the effect of contact, so the contact effect (*b*~2~) is the predictive effect of contact for respondents scoring zero on the exposure predictor.

Answer to Question 5. 

* The null hypothesis of an interaction effect in a (multiple) regression
model is that there is no interaction effect between these predictors at all
in the population.
* In other words, the null hypothesis states that the effect of a predictor is
the same at all levels of the moderator in the population. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.4.5)
```

<A name="answer9.4.6"></A>

```{block2, type='rmdanswer', echo=ch9}
Answer to Question 6. 

* If we mean-center contact (the moderator), the reference group changes for effects that are moderated by contact.
* In the model, exposure is the only variable that interacts with contact, so its regression coefficient changes. 

![](figures/S9_4Q6.png)

* This regression coefficient changes from -0.26 to -0.06. Each aditional unit of contact increases the effect of exposure on attitude by 0.04, which is the regression coefficient of the interaction effect. Mean contact score is 5.0, so we add five times 0.04 (= 0.20) to the effect of exposure if we proceed from zero as reference group in the original regression model to 5.0 (on the original contact variable) as reference group in the model with mean-centered contact. 
* In addition, the constant changes. Plug the value 5 for _Contact (0)_ in the blue equation: 0.14 * 5 = 0.70. This value must be added to the constant in the blue equation (0.40 + 0.70), which yields the constant in the red equation: 1.10.

```

<A name="answer9.4.7"></A>

```{block2, type='rmdanswer', echo=ch9}
Answer to Question 7. 

* If contact is set to zero, the blue regression line represents the effect of exposure on attitude for the minimum value of the moderator *contact* (figure below, left panel). Observations with contact scores near zero are blue. There are only a few of them, so we have very few observations for the regression line at this moderator value. These observations do not cover the entire range of exposure values; there are two in the center and one at the right. The regression line has bad common support.

![](figures/S9_4Q7.png)

* If you compare the **Center Contact** slider to the **Adjust the value of Contact** slider, you can see that *M - SD* equals 3 here. Three contacts is one standard deviation below the average number of contacts. 
* Set the **Adjust the value of Contact** slider to 3 to obtain the (blue) regression line expressing the effect of exposure on attitude for people with 3 contacts with smokers (figure above, right panel). 
* Now we can see which observations have contact scores close to 3. There are many blue and dark blue (contact scores very close to 3) dots and they are nicely distributed across the entire range of exposure scores. This regression line has good common support; it is more reliable than the one for minimum (0) number of contacts. [<img src="icons/2question.png" width=161px align="right">](#question9.4.7)

## Take-Home Points

-   An interaction variable represents moderation in a regression model also if the moderator is numerical.

-   An interaction variable is the product of the predictor and moderator.

-   The effect of the predictor in a model with an interaction variable does *not* represent a main or average effect. It is a conditional effect: The effect for cases that score zero on the moderator. The same applies to the effect of the moderator, which is the conditional effect for cases scoring zero on the predictor.

-   The unstandardized regression coefficient of the interaction variable specifies the predicted change in the effect of the predictor on the dependent variable for a one unit increase in the moderator variable.

-   We recommend to mean-center a numerical moderator and a numerical predictor that are involved in an interaction effect. Observations with a mean score on the moderator are a substantively interesting reference group.

-   To interpret moderation, describe the effects (slopes, unstandardized regression coefficients) and visualize the regression lines for some interesting levels of the moderator, such as the mean and one standard deviation below or above the mean.
